    "Let $s_{i,j}$ be the $j$th rating of book $i$ and $n$ the number of ratings for this book. As other users can review a review by saying whether it is helpful, let $k_{i,j}$ be the number of the person who reviewed the review $s_{i,j}$ and let $u_{i,j}$ be the number of reviewer who found the review helpful among the $k_{i,j}$ reviewers. Then what we want to do is to give more weight to reviews which are helpful and less weight to reviews that the other users found useless. The maximum weight a review can have is 1 and the minimum is 0, then if a review has never been reviewed or it has been voted equally helpful and not helpful, its weight will be 0.5 which is neutral.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) A weighted average of the sentiment's intensity in the review taking into account the helpfulness with the weight being derived similarly as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to use the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer from the nltk package. VADER is based on lexicons of sentiment-related words and each words is rated as whether it is positive and negative, and how negative or positive it is. For example, the 'excellent' would be treated as more positive than 'good'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score Vader returns is between -1 and 1, 1 for a very positive review, -1 for a very negative review, and 0 if it is neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Vader is not the most accurate tool and to analyse a piece of text it checks if any of the words in the text are present in the lexicon, therefore its accuracy depends on the coverage of the lexicons. It is the easiest approach we have for the moment as we cannot train a classifier since we don't have a proper training set."

       "\"This book is just plain horrible and for me to say that is saying a lot.  I read everything and a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts novel is like Shakespeare compared to this book.  I picked this book up because I loved Michael Chriton's Timeline so much.  I am facinated with the medieval ages and think the concept of someone from today's time comming in contact with the past is an intresting concept.  Unfortunately this book is not intresting in the least.  I went into the book really wanting to like it but the writing is so stiff and awkard.  The dialogue is not believable in the least.  The romance between Edward and Robyn which should be the focal point of the book is boring.  Edward is like a Ken doll, looks cute but is plastic with no personality.  I guess it doesn't matter in the end because he is not around for most of the story anyway.  If you read this book thinking you will learn something about the medieval ages you will be sorely dissappointed.  Edward doesn't talk like he's really from the medieval ages when he meets Robyn because it's a spell.  How convienent. The author didn't want to do in depth historical research so he uses spells to just explain everything away. I can't believe there are going to be two more books after this one.  If you want to read a wonderful book about the present meeting the medieval past get Timeline.  There is more action, romance, and historical accuracy in Time Line than you will ever find in Knight Errant.\""
