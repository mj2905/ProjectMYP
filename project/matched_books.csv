""The Ice Princess"", by Camilla Lackberg, a novel set in Fj&auml;llbacka, a small town on the coast, is no exception.One cold day, a retired fisherman is going to have a look at the house he had been caring for in the owner's absence. He is shocked to discover the owner, beautiful art gallery owner, Alexandra Wijkner, dead in the bathtub of frozen water. The first person he encounters on the street when he runs out for help, is Erica Falck, the victim's childhood friend, a writer who came back to Fj&auml;llbacka to sort out the household after her parents' tragic death. After reporting Alex's death to the police, Erica finds herself emotionally drawn to the case and her persistence leads to the solution of the crime and many striking discoveries. Also, the young detective, Patrik Hedstrom, is Erica's and Alex's school friend, who always had a sweet spot for Erica... So, there is also an element of romance.""The Ice Princess"" is the first of the ""Patrik Hedstrom"" series. I am very curious how he does as a star detective in the later books, because here, although nice, he is still a bit boyish and nave (although intelligent, empathetic and sensitive, very desirable traits in a detective). I think that advertising this novel as similar to the Larsson and Mankell novels was unfair (aside from the fact, that the Millennium and the Wallander series have nothing in common but the setting and a wide social background). ""the Ice Princess"" is more of a classic mystery set in a close, remote community, with its charms and limitations. The characters are drawn with bold lines, there is a lot of black-and-white, and the social background concentrates more on the relationships between the inhabitants of the area. Not so many nuances and complications. More like theatre. Nevertheless, it is a good novel, I read it with pleasure and I will continue reading the series. I liked Erica and I understand that she will appear in the next novels, so I want to see, how she develops as well. There is already a TV show made in Sweden from the series( 2007). It is a pity that the translation was so late...",Aleksandra Nita-Lazar

Writer Erica is back in her small home town, to clean out her recently deceased parents' house, when her childhood best friend is found dead (in a graphic and visually arresting manner). Having been, in the past, close with that family, Erica becomes involved with the investigation, and gradually dark secrets from all levels of the town are revealed. This was really well done, with excellent characterizations, and a solid plot that kept tightening. It was really good, and I am definitely looking forward to her next title that will be released, The Preacher.This was no The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, in that it was not a high-speed techno thriller, but it was a carefully paced Christie-esque mystery, with that atmospheric Swedish flavor. I liked it much more than Karin Fossum's Down By The Water, which, while dealing with the same subject, managed to be much more offputting and depressing.","Alexandra Henshel ""Librarian/Book Blogger/Pas..."

They were so poetic and beautiful.I did not guess who the killer was, before it was revealed - and I cannot figure out whether that is a good or a bad thing. But the book kept surprising me, there was always another detail revealed.The relationship that evolved between the main character Erica Falck, and the other main character Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m was cute, sweet and quick. All through out the book I was looking forward to reading about them and their relationship!I felt bad for Anna and her kids, her husband is a complete douchebag! And she should just leave him!When it comes to the crime itself, I think it was interesting, a woman found in a bathroom, it looks to be suicide (but of course it is not), and then the investigation gets going and love is in the air!Since I got the entire series as a Christmas present from my boyfriend's family, I will continue to read them and see the movies/series (I know there is some sort of screenplay of the books!)This book gets a 3 heart rating since it is a bit meh, but I still enjoyed it!",AmandaEmma @ Little Miss Reader

Yes, I liked The Ice Princess; yet as the story unfolded, I went from anticipation to mild disappointment. Still I continued to the end, largely because I'm such a fan of Swedish crime fiction.The plot is a good one, and the twists and turns keep the reader interested.  The character of the first murder victim never came alive for me.  She is presented as elusive and private.  Well, she slipped right past me.  I don't know anyone like this in life, yet she was the object of several long-term passions and her murder, and its aftermath drive the plot.Patrick Hedstr&ouml;m, the police investigator is an appealing character and the incipient romance between him and the main narrator is well played. The depiction of the police investigative team was lively and human.  Mellborg, the chief investigator and preening [...], jumps off the page. Minor characters are sharply drawn. I was not so fond of the main narrator, Erika Falck, a struggling Weight Watcher, and the improbable reason she has for involving herself in the investigation. Other characters too had weak motivations.The prose style was overblown, with very little color.  The dialogue was wooden at times. You can't blame everything on the translator, Steven T. Murray, who did such a masterful job of translating Stieg Larssson's Millennium Trilogy. You can't blame the translator either for an idyllic presentation of a Swedish coastal town. Or for the story's slow, and sometimes repetitive pace.The horrific secret  that drives the plot was glossed over too quickly for my taste. What? That's it? Isn't anybody going to react to one of the central facts?A good read, all in all nonetheless.  I look forward to the translation of L&auml;ckberg's other novels which are bestsellers in Sweden.",Amazon Customer

The characters -- particularly that of the female protagonist, Erica Falck, come alive, and engage one's emotions as well as one's intellectual interest.

Her parents have died and she's cleaning out their home, her brother-in-law is pressuring her to sell the place, and her childhood friend has just committed suicide. Erica is under a heavy load, feeling herself at a crossroad. So it's a pleasant surprise when she reconnects with another friend from her childhood, police detective Patrik Hedstrom, who's looking into the suicide.This series of books features the relationship of writer Falck and detective Hedstrom, and in this debut we see them getting to know each other as adults. There are quite a few characters, and I had to take notes, though I don't mind that. I thought the premise was very good and the characters interesting. The characters were not, however, deep or intriguing. The pace was dull at times. At nearly 400 pages, it could have benefited from an editor's touch. We got lots of detail about people's actions, but I didn't feel we ever got any deeper into their psyches, even the two major characters, Patrik and Erica. Late in the book when Erica finds out various truths and secrets, she tells us she's &#34;so angry&#34;, but that's as deep as it goes. Hmm. I am hoping that the next books in the series will be more revelatory. The ending of several story threads felt rushed, and some weren't addressed at all. I guess that's partly to be continued in the second book, but it still felt unsatisfying.The book is good enough and the characters interesting enough, though, that I will read the next in the series. I also look forward to seeing how author Lackberg grows as a writer.

People that live there rarely want to leave. All is not as it seems though. Small towns can hold big secrets. You know the saying, ""Two people can share a secret -- if one of them is dead."" Someone has taken that to heart.Erica Falck returns to her hometown to settle her parents' estate after their death in a car accident. She didn't expect to find the frozen corpse of her childhood best friend. Despite all signs pointing to suicide, Erica feels like Alex wouldn't and didn't kill herself.Patrick Hedstrom is the officer assigned to the case. Hobbled by an incompetent supervisor, he tries to uncover why someone would kill, and in Fjallbacka. With ingenuity and some prompts from Erica, he works slowly but surely to solve the mystery.The mystery is complicated by the fact that in a small town like Fjallbacka everyone seemingly knows each others business. Can there be any secrets worth killing for? Who would have such a secret? Why murder now? Horrific deeds come to life despite the best efforts of several people including the murderer to keep them hidden.There was lots of extraneous info in this book. The characters constantly repeating each others ideas or withholding information from each other. There are several sections showing either Erica's or Patrick's angst regarding the other. The multiple viewpoints, one of which isn't revealed until later in the book, can be very distracting.Overall, the book was well done. The main characters were pretty well done and had pretty clearly defined personalities. The plot was suspenseful and had several interesting twists.

The budding relationship between these two, tentative and unsure of each other, is central to the storyline and whilst quite nicely done, at times had chicklit overtones.After struggling with the first few chapters, I really liked it. A 'slow-burner' rather than a 'page-turner' that flowed well and kept me reading to the end. The small town community with its twitching curtains was well depicted and the characters interested me. There seemed to be quite a lot of side threads where additional characters were introduced with quite lengthy background detail only to then vanish from the pages which I found quite strange, but on the whole an enjoyable read and I'll certainly be reading the second book in the series The Preacher.",Big Bertha

I found it really disappointing.First, the positives:Fun to read the Swedish detail, and the opening is very good.  The dead woman is a strong and intriguing character, and the crime at the heart of the novel is good.  A lot of the secondary characters are interesting and well written.The negatives:The main character and the main detective are not very interesting or appealing.  American mystery and suspense fans will be surprised to find that many secrets are kept from the reader.  On several occasions, an important clue is discovered by one of our leads but we wait a long time to find out what it is.  As in, &#34;She looked at the piece of paper and realized this changed everything about case&#34; (I'm paraphrasing here), and then we wait 50 pp to find out what it is.  I found this extremely annoying.  The discussion questions at the end of the book compare the author to Agatha Christie, but this is not a fairly clued puzzle mystery of that type.In short:  I read to the end and some parts of the book were good, so I gave it three stars.  But I cannot understand why it is so highly praised, and I won't read another one by this author.Finally, I was puzzled by this paragraph:&#34;Snow must have just fallen over the city; the grass was still white.  In Stockholm, it only took a day or two for snow to turn into a dirty-grey slush.  She placed her mittens on a park bench and then sat down on them as protection under her seat.

23426,0007269854,3,"Not Stieg Larsson, but has some potential",A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,"[2, 2]","Stieg Larsson first introduced me to the wonder of Scandinavian murder mystery writers, and my horizons were further expanded by reading some Henning Mankell and Jo Nesbo.  I've become such a fan of these writers, that I immediately snapped this book up when I saw it, hoping for more of the same.  Larsson isn't the world's best writer in that his prose can be clunky, but he excels at lighting a fuse and then dropping bombs on his readers.  Mankell's work can be just as pulse-pounding, but his prose is more polished.  Nesbo writes with great skill about the psychology of his main character.  Unfortunatly for Lackberg, she doesn't quite live up to these standards.  Still, as I read, I couldn't help feeling that maybe she was on to something and that, with time and polish, her work could become just as compelling.One of the major problems in this novel, in my opinion, is an excess of minor plot threads.  The main murder plot was an interesting one, and I was engrossed in unraveling the entire story behind the murder.  I also thought the back story of the alcoholic painter (whose name escapes me) was interesting.  There was some potential to the plot with Erica's sister, Anna, but it felt tacked on to me.  I had the impression that the author wanted to insert an important issue into her plot, but I just didn't feel it was fully developed.  I think that the fact that it has nothing to do whatsoever with the main murder plot also gave me the feeling that it had been tacked on.Related to this is Lackberg's choice to tell the story from shifting perspectives.  I don't mind books with shifting narratives, but I don't like it when an author makes the choice not to write from an omniscient point of view, but then feels the need to tell the story from a minor character's point of view for a section or two, simply to make sure that their side is aired.  To me, this feels clumsy and unnecessary.  If an author chooses to take a limited perspective, then the reader should sometimes be left without a perfect understanding of the motivations of tertiary characters.  If it's really important to the narrative, the author should use that character throughout the book, rather than just in a passage or two simply to better explain one minor plot thread.  This may just be a pet peeve of mine but, at any rate, I feel this device always detracts from the narrative.As for her characters, I felt that they were uneven.  Erica was the most well-developed, likely because she is the major character.  Erica has some warts, which I liked.  She didn't alienate me with her perfection; rather, I found that I was often able to identify with her insecurities.  However, I couldn't help but feel that she was exploiting the victim's family at times, and this bothered me.  It made her seem a bit underhanded, which really didn't enhance her character.I was quite fond of Patrik who was, for me, Lackberg's most endearing character.  I was especially amused by the parallels between his body insecurities and those of Erica as they began their romance, which I thought was sweet.  Patrik was a bit bumbling, but I also thought he was resourceful and intelligent, and I found the manner in which he hands his boss to be pretty clever, though I did think the boss was overdone and frankly ridiculous.What really does the novel a disservice, in my opinion, is the extraneous detail.  Lackberg has an interesting concept here, and her execution is pretty good.  The problem lies in the sense that the reader has to wade through a lot of unnecessary information in order to get to the plot.  I like literary mysteries, but the authors of this particular genre need to be cautious not to bog the reader down with so many secondary plots that they end up skimming so that they can get back to the real meat of the story.  I think that, with time, experience, and editing, Lackberg could become a very well-rounded author.",Bookphile

There are many suspects, perhaps too many. Also, some characters were well delineated whereas others were cookie cutter variety.  I could have used fewer characters and a more penetrating look at those who remained. The pace is somewhat leisurely which most people are not looking for in a thriller or mystery.  Perhaps fewer characters and fewer twists would solve this problem.  I am not sure I will read another book by her. I think the central problem is that this book could not make up its mind which genre it wanted to be in so tried to blend romance with thriller-mystery.  It is rare to find a writer who can blend those genres well.  Most don't.  I think if you are in the mood for a romantic suspense novel, you may like this book.

Erica not only writes, grieves for her parents and her lost friendship with the deceased Alex, she has to deal with her younger sister and her grasping husband. Patrik is not only investigating the death of Erica's childhood friend, he has to cope with the boss from hell. Erica and Patrik are attracted to each other, and it's a romance that's well done: enough detail to make romance lovers' toes curl a bit without turning off those who prefer their whodunits with guns and no roses.L&auml;ckberg's interest in people and motivation is clear in The Ice Princess. She also shows a great deal of skill in meting out details to keep the suspense percolating. I can't help but feel that, although she's got two great characters in Erica and Patrik, L&auml;ckberg has the most fun with Patrik's boss, Bertil Mellberg:""What she considered his most repulsive feature, however, was the atrocious comb-over he had constructed to hide his bald pate. He had let the remaining strands of hair grow out-- his employees could only guess how long they must be-- and then he wound the hair round atop his head in an arrangement that most resembled an abandoned crow's nest.""What's scary about Mellberg is that, although his characterization borders on buffoonery, L&auml;ckberg doesn't put a foot wrong because I swear I once worked with his twin!Mellberg aside, I truly enjoyed reading this book. L&auml;ckberg is a very visual writer; Scandinavian furniture makers, interior designers and food magazines are mentioned that were totally unknown to me, but I wasn't bothered. That's what an Internet connection and search engines are for. Looking up some of the unfamiliar names helped me see with L&auml;ckberg's eyes and educated me, all at the same time. For those readers who don't care about such things, they are very easily ignored.I deduced what had happened to Alex as a child, but that didn't take away any enjoyment of this book. Good pacing and story combined with excellent characters and motivations to make for a very pleasurable read.

It's not because the narrator was flat, but that the book was so darn good that I couldn't help but want to read it RIGHTNOW to find out what happened.This is the type of work that people will either become entirely engrossed in or be so bored that they'll find themselves counting ceiling tiles. It's very much a character driven book in that the mystery itself isn't entirely the driving force here. There's never a true sense of dread or danger, at least not from the murderer. What dread we do see Erica experience is entirely from the people around her in her day-to-day life. The murder is important and is the impetus for a lot of events, but by large the main point of the novel is to show Erica's life and what motivates her. The death of Erica's old friend Alex is almost incidental at times.That's why I think that a lot of people looking for a more traditional mystery or thriller will probably find themselves a little bored, at least if they're also the type who isn't into works such as this. I remember this getting fairly heavily compared to Stieg Larsson's books, but I can't tell you if it's an apt comparison or not.Overall this really was a great read and while there were a few rough spots here and there, I sped through this fairly quickly. The narration for the audiobook was very well done and I may go back to it at some point. (I do want to note that there is a radio version for the BBC that is very, very heavily abridged. I found a snippet of it, but it seems to pretty much remove a lot of the personal drama, which is the main focus of the book as a whole.)","ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!"""

Erica Falck has returned to her hometown of Fjallbacka, Sweden to deal with the estate of her parents, leaving behind an unsuccessful career and unfulfilled dreams in the big city. Shortly after her return, she discovers the body of her childhood best friend, Alex, frozen in the bathtub, apparently dead by suicide. The two women hadn't spoken in years, but Erica is still driven to discover, at first, why Alex, who seemed to have a perfect life, would kill herself, and later to find the identity of Alex's murderer. Sparks fly between Erica and police detective Patrik, and the two bond over the investigation. The case brings up long buried secrets of the community, including secrets about Erica's own childhood. Lackberg's writing pulls the reader into the story through detailed scenes and creating great tension.

23453,0007269854,3,Swedish Agatha Christie?,A359U0JFFZ0Q04,"[0, 1]","Camilla Lackberg has been described as the Agatha Christie of Sweden, probably because of the small town setting of Fjallbacka and lead character Erica Falck's amateur detective status. She's an author.Erica is confronted with the apparent suicide of her childhood friend Alex Wijkner, whom she hadn't seen in twenty-five years. In short order the ME rules the death a suicide and the game is afoot. Erica is aided and abetted by local detective Patrik Hedstrom. Although Erica does some snooping around, Patrik actually does most of the work. They've also known each other since their youth; he's been worshipping her from afar.Agatha Christie's mysteries have an effortless structure to them. Camilla Lackberg was originally an economist, and she's got some shortcomings. For one thing you don't put backstory in the middle of a scene. Then there are some terrible lapses in respect to some of her characters. What's the deal with Eilert Berg for instance? Is he important enough to be included at the beginning and at the end of the story? Then there's police chief Bertil Mellberg who's a complete joke; he even sports a Donald Trump combover that keeps falling off his head. One review refers to him as comic relief, but there's nothing funny about him and he`s just not realistic. The town rich lady Nelly Lorentz sounds like something out of Dickens. Her son Nils' earlier disappearance is another dilemma Erica and Patrik must deal with, and the plot resolution in relation to him is just too convenient to be believed.There are also several minor plot lines that interfere with the flow of the story. Erica's little sister, Anna, is suffering spousal abuse and her husband is bullying her into selling the family homestead. Erica, of course, can't  bear to lose the place.Despite the above, there are several elements that I actually like. Patrik is a likable character and he and Erica make a cute couple. What humor there is in the story occurs during their awkward early relationship. She's been putting on weight, and she's worried he'll think she's fat. Coincidentally he feels the same way about himself and sucks in his stomach around her.Anders Nilsson the tortured artist who had been having an affair with Alex is also an interesting character. I also had no idea who killed Alex Wijkner until Lackberg actually told me, and I can usually spot the killer early on.I'll definitely give her another chance; her work is a touch above what passes for a mystery in America today.

The reason for Erica's return is to take care of the things because of the death of her parents.  Erica is especially looking forward meeting with her best friend from youth, Alexandra Wijkner, but just before she will be back home Alexandra will be found dead, frozen in her bathtub and all indicates that she committed a suicide.Although the two of them broke up contact two years ago and she is not familiar with all the details that have occurred in recent times, for Erica is still hard to believe that her friend decided on such way to end her life because Alex was a beautiful woman, being married to good and successful husband, living a comfortable and almost carefree life.Besides their friendship that makes her to reveal more details, her professional instinct will be too strong therefore Erica will decide to write a work about what happened to Alex. Together with another common friend from the past, local detective Patrik Hedstrom, they two will begin with an investigation to discover all the details.Soon they will discover that there is a lot of things which indicate that perhaps it was not a suicide that happens to Alex, and that a small fishing village beneath the surface hides many dark secrets that obviously influenced the fate of this unfortunate woman...`The Ice Princess' is not a typical thriller that will make reader with its fast pace to constantly turn the pages in anticipation of what will happen, but slowly introduces the reader into the story by offering a quality slowly unraveling plot on this more than 400 pages long novel. Camilla L&auml;ckberg used a lot of psychological motives that may not appeal to everyone because sometimes the author sacrificed the action to clarify one's emotions, thinking or psychological state.It seems that the author had not devoted equal attention to all her characters, because while some are extremely rich and multilayered characterized, some others are almost funny and on the verge of cartoons, seeming a bit unnecessary such as Erica sister - however, it can certainly be attributed to the debut work, and it will be interesting to read the following.The only thing that is not in accordance with the level of quality of the rest of her work is description of the police work that makes it evident about this part the author has not done enough good research. As far as Erica is a natural talent, having a great detective nose, any serious police in the world would not allow such important omissions in the investigation.It may be objected by some readers that the novel could be a bit shorter that would accelerate its pace and make it more interesting, but it is a personal opinion. In the form in which it is delivered to the reader `The Ice Princess' provides a well-made story, not so fast in pace, but with good plot and interesting outcome that will intrigue reader to look for other Camilla L&auml;ckberg's titles translated or in original.",Denis Vukosav

The Ice Princess is set in a small fishing village in Sweden and is headed by engaging characters Erica and Patrik with an excellent support cast. I enjoy crime stories with a strong sense of place and characters who feel familiar, are flawed, may be likeable but not all will be. So it's a joy to read a book such as The Ice Princess where setting, characterisation and strong plot are not secondary to action and where the characters' lives continue to carry on whilst the crime story itself moves towards climax.Amongst books by other Scandinavian authors, I've read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and stopped at that book in the series.

The protagonist makes a phone call, ID's a critical person and hangs up the phone, shocked, but the author makes us wait to find out who it is.

The story starts out promisingly enough, with the discovery of a woman's dead body in a bathtub of frozen water.  Her wrists had been slit and she bled to death.  Suicide?  No, murder.The path to discovery of the murderer is clumsy: too many intersecting story lines, too many changes in point of view, too many characters inadequately developed. And the careful police work that marks the novels of Larsson, Mankell and Nesb, for example, is nowhere to be found here.  The investigating officer, Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m, seems to stumble from one lucky insight to another, but not in a way that is at all believable.  His supervisor and colleagues are amusingly inept, but there's nothing credible about the way Patrik goes about solving this central crime and other ancillary ones thrown in to complicate things a bit.  Worst of all, there's no tension in this book, no menace.  None of the characters are in any danger. It's merely a whodunit, and not a very good one.

When she sees one of her close friends, Alex Wijkner, in the bathtub with her wrists slit, she assumes the worst and calls the police.Once the police are there, they investigate it and determine that Alex has been murdered and the crime scene was made to look like a suicide.  From there, Ms. Lackberg introduces us to a group of memorable characters and creates a great murder mystery that is compelling from start to finish.Much of the formatting of this book reminds me of one of my favorite authors, John Dickson Carr.  On one hand, it's hard to compare Patrik Hedstrom to Dr. Gideon Fell because Carr based his books on Fell's brilliance in solving crimes.  Lackberg doesn't do that but there isn't a need to do that.  The story is engaging enough that she brings out other characters in the story as well.As far as point of view is concerned, like Carr, Lackberg writes from the point of view from different characters in the story.  Everyone of them has a past and it adds to the mystery to make it hard to put down.Take police chief Helberg for example.  He's the obnoxious boss who draws the wrong conclusions about the murder and is on Hedstrom's back to solve the murder so he can take all the credit for it and be promoted.  He's a comic character as well when we see him in his chair stuffing his mouth with chocolates.The book is not only a mystery but a great story for literary fans as well.  The relationships are dysfunctional and it adds great value to the investigation.  The relationships hit home for Erica also since she is in love with Patrik and her sister is a victim of domestic violence.If you're looking for a book that has a great mystery and memorable characters, then this is for you.

So, when Lackberg's new book is compared to the Scandinavian publishing phenomenon, it doesn't register much with me.Maybe that's a good thing. There's nothing to compare The Ice Princess to. I'm not a reader of the recent craze of Swedish noir, though I will venture into Henning Mankell territory next week. Thus, this novel will be considered strictly on its own merits.The Story:Erica Falck moves to her hometown of Fjallbacka, Sweden after the death of her parents. A writer, she is attempting to finish her fourth biography when she discovers the death of her childhood friend, Alex.  Found in a tub of nearly frozen water with both wrists slashed, Alex's death sets off an investigation to which no one person is exempt. Erica is drawn into the tragedy and mystery surrounding the life and death of her estranged friend. Along with Patrik Hedstrom, a police detective assigned to the case, Erica finds out more about the quiet close-knit seaside community than she ever wanted to know.The Review:There was so much going on in this thriller. A prodigious amount of colorful characters: from the eccentric elderly Mrs. Petren, who uses thousands of Santas and a state of the art coffee machine to ensure a steady stream of guests; to the aging socialite Nelly Lorentz, who is somehow involved in Alex's death; to Alex's sister, Julia, who is grieving in a very unusual way.Lackberg touches on a number of issues--domestic violence, child abuse, negligence, mental illness, and adultery--without devolving into the typical moralistic fare. Every detail of human nature is spot on, except the voice of the victim of domestic violence; in this case, it seems Lackberg consulted case studies and assigned the voice of the psychologist to the victim herself.In addition to that, there was an awkwardness to some of the sentences; I don't know whether that was caused by the translator or the author herself. It's nothing especially jarring, just an awareness of the bump in the flow.In addition to that, one of my chief complaints is that the deceased character seems to be the one most filled with life. Alex is well defined, which distinguishes from most of the other characters. Even Erica's voice didn't seem quite her own (as much as the author's) until about 100 pages in, when the writing noticeably improves and the story becomes more gripping.I've heard that Lackberg's writing improves with each new book, so I'm interested to see how the next one goes.This story was engrossing, the characters profound, and the atmosphere well drawn.The Opinion:Aside from those negatives, The Ice Princess is a fast, light read that will keep you racing through the pages to find answers that will make your jaw drop.

Set in the Swedish coastal town of Fj&auml;llbacka, the book follows well-known biography author Erica Falck, who has returned to the town after the tragic death of her parents in an accident. She plans to stay for a while to get their affairs in order and finish her latest book. One day while on a walk, she is flagged down by an elderly caretaker who has found a disturbing sight--the body of a woman lying in a bathtub of frozen water and blood. It turns out this woman was Alexandra Wijkner, Erica's best childhood friend, from whom she was inseparable, until they were 10 years old, when they inexplicably drifted apart and Alexandra's family moved away. For a woman who appeared to have everything--a successful art gallery, a handsome and wealthy husband, a beautiful and historic home--the idea of Alexandra committing suicide seems difficult for anyone to fathom.Erica is asked by Alexandra's parents to write an article about her for the local newspaper, and as she does research into her life since their friendship ended, she becomes convinced that Alexandra's death might not have been a suicide after all. She also tries to figure out why Alexandra drifted away all of those years ago. Teaming up with Patrik, another childhood friend who is now a police detective, she begins to discover that the case isn't as clear cut as it looks, and there are many secrets many people in Fj&auml;llbacka want to leave hidden.I feel a little bit of pity for any Swedish author whose work gets publicity in America, because they all get compared to Stieg Larsson. And in fact, a blurb on the cover this book says, ""Stieg Larsson fans who give this book a chance will be rewarded."" I enjoyed this book, but it's nothing like Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, so don't go into this book expecting that. However, many of the characters are richly layered, and while some of the secondary characters were a little too clich&eacute;d for me, the plot took some very interesting twists and kept me flipping pages fairly quickly. Erica wasn't your typical accidental detective and certainly was far from omniscient, and that made her curiousity about the case even more interesting. Apparently this is the first of seven books L&auml;ckberg has written about Fj&auml;llbacka (I know at least the next one features Erica and Patrick), so I'm definitely going to keep reading them.

In this story of two violent deaths fueled by the simmering resentments and psychopathologies of similarly violent childhoods, Lackberg skillfully weaves multiple perspectives and characterizations to keep the reader guessing up until the bitter end.  So what's the issue?Is it the scores of characters who weave their way in and out of this 400ish page tale of an amatuer writer-detective whose childhood friend is brutally murdered, then left to bleed out and freeze over in her own bathtub?  (I counted at least a dozen different perspectives in the first chapter alone...)Is it the brief descriptions of myriad Swedish exteriors and interiors for which I have no visual reference points?  (I'll look them up now.)Is it that I was expecting an action thriller but got a highly psychological and moderately paced mystery instead?  (Possibly.)I don't know.I do know that if this is considered a suspense novel, as it was described by its publishers, then my previous generalizations about the state of the genre (based on a current bestseller) must be seriously amended.  In fact, The Ice Princess stacks up quite favorably against the current bestseller by a famously prolific author from which I drew my conclusions.  Does this bode well for Lackberg's career and her future novels?  One hopes it does.Did this novel pass the time pleasantly?  Absolutely.  Was the 'Bridget Jones without the humor' heroine reasonably believable and sympathetic?  Indeed.  Did the plot move forward at a steady pace with occasional twists and turns and blind alleyways for good measure?  Yes.  Subplots in which the protagonist's personal life repeatedly intersects with her sleuthing?  Check.  Satisfying romantic developments?  Check.So if you're looking for those qualities in your next light read, and especially if you've ever held a fascination for Swedish culture and scenery, Lackberg's debut on the North American scene will suit the bill nicely.MFB with a fresh perspective on a popular genre,L",Laurie

The novel tells about writer Erica Falck who comes back to her hometown, a small fishing village, only to find her childhood girlfriend, Alex, dead.  At first it seems that Alex has committed suicide, but then the story takes some twists and turns and what seems to be a clear cut case turns out to be anything but.Enter police detective Patrik Hedstrom and his bumbling colleagues at the Tanumshede police station.  Patrik follows his own clues and intuitions about the case, while falling in love with Erica, whom he had a crush on since childhood.  Working together, Patrik and Erica (who is planning a book about the murder while suffering from writer's block) start to piece together the truth about Alex.  The dark secrets which inhibit every small town start to emerge and the people who would like those secrets to remain buried begin to surface.Both Patrik and Erica are well developed, interesting and likeable characters.  The plot is very good and gets better as the characters of Fj&auml;llbacka start to immerge. Lackberg does her best to build suspense and gradually lets out secrets about the community in general and about the murder specifically.I found the setting of a claustrophobic small fishing town of Fj&auml;llbacka to be the most intriguing character.  L&auml;ckberg does a masterful job capturing the feel of a small town with lots of bad history to bury, where every ripple causes a big effect in the lives of many people.  The seemingly idyllic town, where rich people flock to buy summer houses for peaceful, restful and pleasant vacations, holds many dark riddles which the townsfolk would rather be left uncovered.Ms. L&auml;ckberg is a very visual writer; she describes the scenes in a few words which gives the reader a vision to work from in their own minds.  I read about furniture makers I've never heard about, designers I cannot pronounce, and magazines which seem interesting enough for me to look through.  Needless to say Google worked overtime during my reading.""The Ice Princess"" is interesting but I found it slow at times and had to trudge through the narrative at several places.  The story is slow to start and the book only becomes really interesting towards the latter half.  There are lots of twists and turns, several times I was disappointed and thought I solved the mystery half way through the book, only to find out I was wrong - and happily so.  There are no chase scenes, shootings, brawls or any of the like, the plot woven together tightly with a net spreading around the whole seaside town.However, the story telling is patchy with, what seems to me as simply fillers.  For example, we are privy to Erica's reflections about her new romance with Patrik which did not advance the plot.  Oddly, given the filler material such as what underwear to wear for a date (as if men care), it seems as though the author was rushing through subplots, where a longer book or less subplots might have been better.Even though the story unfolds very slowly, the big ending felt rushed, a ""Star Trek"" ending if you will, where a complex plot is being tied up in a neat package with only five minutes of airtime left.  That's too bad because it was anticlimactic, and after 290 pages we deserve better.Some of the characters speak in a cartoonish way, almost robotic but I don't hold that against the book due to the fact that it was written in Swedish and the prose could have gotten lost in translation.  What I do hold against the English editor and proofreader (assuming there was one) is that there are mistakes in the eBook version (""ho"" instead of ""no"", etc.).  Those things are simply unacceptable in a finished product - no matter how fast you want to release it to the public in order to capitalize on the ""Swedish crime fiction"" craze sweeping the literary world.That being said, the ""The Ice Princess"" is a good read, not very demanding and an interesting ""who done it"".  Even though I think the editing could have been better, and the translation more fluid, this novel is still a satisfying read.Side note:This is the second Swedish crime novel I've read where the police are portrayed with such high level of incompetence (except the protagonist) that makes the Keystone Cops look proficient.  Also, as in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" series, everyone drinks coffee, or about to drink coffee, or making coffee, or offering coffee - all the time, at every hour of the day or night.  At first I thought it was some sort of an internal joke but now I'm seriously considering buying stocks for companies which produce or import coffee to Sweden.",Man of La Book

Nevertheless, this doesn't mean The Ice Princess is not a fine novel for it is. Had I read it first, I would probably be more impressed.

The local inspector who works on the case is a friend of her. Long time ago he was in love with her. Can old flames sparkle again?The main character here is Erica.

23508,0007269854,4,"""You should never underestimate the need not to make waves in a small town.""",A319KYEIAZ3SON,"[3, 5]","Swedish author Camilla Lackberg won France's Le Grand Prix de Litterature Policier for Best International Crime Novel of the Year when this novel was published in Sweden (2008).  Her unique style and sense of plot have won her numerous prizes, not only in her own country, but throughout the world, where this book has now been translated into twenty-five languages.  The Ice Princess begins mysteriously with an unnamed person finding a woman's body in a filled bathtub in a rural house so cold that ice has formed around her.  Her wrists are slashed in an apparent suicide. The woman is former resident Alexandra Wijkner, nee Carlgren, who grew in this house and who had been visiting it regularly on weekends.  Erica Falck, a writer, had been her best friend until Alex unexpectedly fled Fjallbacka when she was ten.  As Erica begins her research into Alex's life for an article for the local newspaper, she soon finds herself working informally with Patrik Hedstrom, a local policeman who had loved Erica from afar when they were schoolmates.In the course of the novel, the intersecting lives of the townspeople unfold.  Though they are of different social levels, the town is small, and everyone has contact with everyone else.  Lackberg creates her characters from the inside out, letting the characters drive her story, the plot developing in a leisurely way as the author presents scenes from the characters' lives and lets the reader see them as people.  Each has some secret life that is not shared with the rest of the town, and Alex, herself, has secrets which, when revealed, will change the lives of many people in Fjallbacka.For readers accustomed to crime novels filled with macho heroes, extravagant action, chases, shoot-outs, and fights to the death, Lackberg may be a surprise, though the novel certainly has plenty of action.  Her characters are not larger than life--they reflect real life, generally ordinary people, rooted in reality, who, when faced with extraordinary events, try to deal with them in ordinary ways.  As the various characters live their lives and discover tiny pieces of information, the reader begins to acquire a bigger picture of the circumstances surrounding Alex's death.  The mystery is enhanced by five anonymous meditations scattered throughout the novel which reveal the inner world of one or more characters.As in real life, there are some small issues which do not get resolved--we never know why one or two people don't tell the truth--and a few subplots could have used some pruning. Lackberg, the literary juggler, successfully keeps many balls in the air at once, and as an additional death occurs and crimes from the past are discovered, resolution, if not reconciliation, occurs.  The secret underlying all the action is stunning in its depravity and in the lengths to which some people will go to preserve secrecy.  This is a carefully conceived mystery which will delight those whose interests lean toward the inner worlds of the characters rather than their willingness to take up the sword.

Camilla Lackberg was born here, and she brings alive the salty air, the wonderful seascapes, the muscular bodies of the local fisherman, and the sharp tongues of the local gossips.The heroine of this book, Erica Falck, also grew up in Fjallback, and she's going through the house of her recently dead parents when we meet her, trying to get things in order. Almost immediately she's thrown into a sensational murder case. Erica's childhood friend Alexandra is found dead in an icy bathtub, her murder ineptly disguised as suicide.The Ice Princess is not just a murder mystery, but also a love story. Erika, unmarried at thirty-five, gets involved with the divorced police officer investigating the case. He's just her age. Their insecurities (they both weigh a few extra pounds) make for amusing reading as their shy courtship progresses.The relationships in general are quite interesting, since everyone went to school together or interacted somehow with each other in the past. The mystery of who killed Alex is only one of several mysteries and secrets lurking around Fjallback. And Lackberg ties all the complexities of the story together quite deftly. There's even a pleasing cyclical elegance to the plot, which begins and ends with murder.The main characters are full-blooded beings who could be your own friends or relatives.

Erica Falck, coming home to live in her parents' house in a small village after they die, discovers the body of a childhood friend, Alexandra Calgren, apparently a suicide in her own bathtub.Forensics quickly proves that it was no suicide, and the mystery takes off from there.Erica is a writer, and no sleuth, but she discovers important clues that allow her policeman-boyfriend, Patrik Hedstrom, to finally put it all together.But it takes a long time for this to happen.  The paperback is 453 pages of dense and  twisting plots.  Some have complained that all these sidetrips are neither interesting nor necessary, but in fact they are key to the killer's motivation.  And on the way, Lackberg introduces an enormous array of village characters.  She is exceptionally good at psychology, and even better at sociology--the interactions and interconnections of many people of many different classes.Another criticism is that Lackberg telegraphs her punches.  This is certainly true for some things, for example, the trauma in Alexandra's background that caused her to drop Erica and take a sharp turn in her history.  But it is not true for the main killer, who remains bafflingly elusive till the end.Overall, if you like novels as well as mystery novels, you will probably like this.

23534,0007269854,3,Sweden's answer to Agatha Christie?  Not so much.,A1YIYOAUTKQE6,"[122, 134]","I'm a huge fan of Scandinavian crime fiction, and Sweden has produced some sensational authors: Henning Mankell, Stieg Larsson, Liza Marklund, Karin Alvtegen (and this is not an exhaustive list).  While Camilla L&auml;ckberg shows some promise, she has a long way to go before she can be considered of similar calibre.The novel's premise is intriguing: writer Erica Falck's best childhood friend, with whom she lost touch, dies suddenly, apparently by her own hand.  As Erica, in tandem with another childhood friend (and eventual love interest), local copper Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m, look into the circumstances further, they find that the explanation is not so simple. Inevitably, they uncover secrets that have been hidden for decades.The claustrophobic small town setting is relatively well drawn, and the novel started off really promisingly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of issues with it that interfere with the flow of the story.  Another reviewer has commented on the numerous ""filler"" scenes, full of redundant information, which bog down the narrative - for example, too frequently we have a scene where Character A tells Character B the same information that the reader has already been told on the previous page. Similarly, while Patrik and Erica are engaging characters, I really did not care about their incipient romance and Erica's repetitive musings on ""Does he like me?  Will I look fat in this?"" became tedious (yes, we even have a Bridget Jones-esque scene where Erica debates whether to go with the lacy undies or the supportive nanna knickers, and just in case we don't get what has inspired this scene, Bridget Jones is helpfully referenced in the text ... mildly amusing at best, but did not advance the plot one jot, and should have been cut). Nor, for example, did we really need to know about the romantic history and family life of Patrik's friend, Robert the forensic scientist - he only appears in a few pages of one chapter.  I found myself skimming those scenes.  Further, I felt that the themes of domestic violence and child abuse were not explored quite as well as they could have been, and dealt with quite simplistically. The big reveals towards the end felt rushed and somewhat anticlimactic.The character development is a bit patchy, partly because there is far too much telling rather than showing, and too many POV shifts. Erica herself, and Nelly Lorentz, a wealthy widow with an apparently inexplicable interest in the deceased's victim's family, are the most well developed and interesting.  Patrik is the standard nice guy, bordering on Marty Stu territory.  By contrast, Erica's sister Anna's husband, Lucas, is a cardboard cutout villain, with no trace of the charm that supposedly led Anna to fall for him in the first place.  While we frequently see him only through the eyes of Erica, who can't stand him, there is no complexity to him at all; this subplot would have been much more effective had he and Erica been on good terms, with Erica slowly becoming uneasy that things are not quite right.  In fact, I think this storyline would have been better dealt with standing alone; it really had little relevance to the major plot.The prose is uneven, especially the dialogue, with characters speaking in an often stilted and unnatural way and overusing each other's names; seriously, no-one in real life talks like that unless they're a telemarketer who rings you in the middle of dinner.  I acknowledge this could at least partly be due to the translation, but unfortunately I don't read Swedish so cannot compare it to the original. Either way, some judicious editing would have helped.I've given it three stars because it is a reasonable, not too demanding holiday read.  However, despite what the publisher's spiel claims, L&auml;ckberg is not yet any threat to Agatha Christie based on this effort.",Rachel

And Detective Patrik Hedstrom and the author Erica Falck are delightful characters, surprisingly pretty ordinary people who suffer from the normal everyday insecurities about their weight, work and love life. It would be interesting to follow their relationship in later books.I've read some reviews that say that Camilla L&auml;ckberg's later novels in the series are much better written, so maybe I'll check them out inspite of this first book not quite meeting high expectations.",RandomizeME
23536,0007269854,4,Chilling American debut by Swedish Crime Queen.,A19O53R0L0W4O7,"[0, 0]","The greatest contribution the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson made to the world was opening the doors for several other Scandinavian authors to enjoy similar international acclaim.  Larsson's  ""Millennium Trilogy"" (consisting of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"") are still atop the best-seller's list worldwide and have been made into a successful series of Swedish films (and soon to be American versions directed by David Fincher).Along with fellow authors like Hakan Nesser and Henning Mankell, Camilla Lackberg has joined the fray.  Already dubbed ""The Swedish Crime Queen"", Ms. Lackberg has turned her career as an economist into best-seller stardom all due to taking a course in creative writing that changed her life.  She has been publishing top-selling fiction in Sweden since 2005 and is now beginning to enjoy similar success in the U.S.  Her novel, THE ICE PRINCESS, was originally released in her home country in 2008 and already has received international acclaim.What makes her series of novels so popular --- they feature the unique pairing of authoress Erica Falck and her husband, Detective Patrik Hedstrom.  In THE ICE PRINCESS, Ericka is drawn into the alleged suicide of a childhood friend named Alex.  Those who know Alex best insist this is not a suicide but cold-blooded murder (she was found in a bathtub full of blood).  Toxicology reports support that there may have been a poisoning involved and now everyone in Alex's world is a suspect.To further complicate matters, Erica has decided to base her next novel on the life of her old friend, Alex.  Having lost touch with her for many years, Erica has a good deal of ground to make up.  As her research begins --- initially speaking with family members, her husband, neighbors and friends --- Erica is able to piece a few things together.  First and foremost, Alex may have been having an affair with a mysterious lover.  Secondly, Alex was pregnant when she died --- and the child is NOT her husband's.Simultaneous to Ericka's quest for the perfect expose/novel, Detective Patrik Hedstrom is heading up his own investigation as part of the local Police Department.  Unfortunately, Patrik has to battle with his head-strong boss who wants a slam-dunk conviction (and a good deal of the credit for having neatly solved the murder case).  When the wrong man is initially apprehended and imprisoned, Patrik must go toe-to-toe with his boss to release this suspect who Patrik knows with confidence is not the murderer.  Now, Patrik must race against his own team to secure enough clues and evidence to lead the way to the true killer.It is when the paths of Erica and Patrik cross that the action of THE ICE PRINCESS truly picks up.  Separately, they have had slow and steady success in their respective cases.  Their combined resources, however, prove to be far more formidable.  The pair begins to delve into the dark secrets that lie beneath the surface of the small Swedish town known as Fjallbacka --- and they are not at all prepared for what they will uncover.  Some secrets should remain hidden and darkness inhabits certain residents of this town that may be claiming more than just Alex as a victim of their evil deeds.What Camilla Lackberg does best is using a great deal of `economy' in her language and this allows for a quick read that permits the reader to instantly enter the world she has created and relate intimately with each of the characters she has depicted.  After devouring THE ICE PRINCESS I'm confident most readers will want to read more from Camilla Lackberg.  As more of her work becomes available stateside I can only hope that the word of mouth about this talented author takes flight!Reviewed by Ray Palen for Rebecca Reads","Ray J. Palen Jr. ""Ray"""

23538,0007269854,4,"A real page-turner, despite flaws...highly recommended",A1JR2IUFFVBE84,"[3, 3]","I'm going to keep this review short and simple, as other reviewers have pointed out several of this novel's flaws.  It certainly does have flaws.  However, the ability to write a suspenseful page-turner is a talent in itself.  Think Dan Brown... I don't know if there is any educated person who thinks that Dan Brown's writing is fine literature; nevertheless, he is able to write thrillers which keep readers entertained from start to finish, something which cannot be said for most authors.  Lackberg possesses this skill.I am a big Stieg Larsson fan, and I found many similarities between Lackberg's writing and Larsson's (and not just the copious amounts of coffee consumed by virtually every character.)  The similarities are so numerous that one might wonder if Lackberg copied Larsson, but this cannot be the case since her first book came out 2 years before Larsson's first book hit the shelves in Sweden.  (I do have to wonder how many of the similarities in tone have to do with the fact that The Ice Princess and the Millennium Trilogy were translated into English by the same translator.  I also have to wonder how much of this book and Larsson's books - which are highly popular but also flawed - was lost in translation.)  Lackberg doesn't weave as intricately-detailed a plot as Larsson does, but she has managed to deliver a thoroughly satisfying reading experience.  I enjoyed this book so much that I read it in just two sittings, and hopped on amazon.co.uk to buy two more of her books (she has written nine, four of which are available in the UK, only one of which is available in the US.)If you enjoyed Stieg Larsson's books and have been looking for a similar reading experience, I highly recommend giving Camilla Lackberg a try.  If nothing else, The Ice Princess is a good way to while away an afternoon, and it keeps you guessing for quite some time.  It should not be dismissed because of its flaws - it should be enjoyed for what it is - an entertaining crime novel which, like certain other popular novels - require the reader to suspend disbelief at times (but not too much.)",Reader
23539,0007269854,4,The Frozen Secret in a Suicide,AJC5CBXX46I8E,"[1, 1]","Although there are some issues I did not like aboutThe Ice Princesstale, these are not reasons for passing up this unique mystery by Camilla Lackberg. The story takes place in Sweden which spends a good bit of its year in deep cold. Just the cover of this tale will make a reader shiver.After finding out that a female friend of twenty-five years past did not, according to forensics reports, commit suicide, Erica attempts to put together the missing pieces of this woman's life. It appears that all agree with police reports, even though Erica finds Anna's body sitting erect, wrists cut, in a bath with ice across the top of the water.Police testing proceedures show that the young woman's death occurred long before she was propped in the tub so that the water would freeze around her as the temperature dropped far below freezing inside her apartment. A home without a furnace would quickly loose heat in such a subzero climate (-30). In this particular story, exactly when the furnace became out-of-order is a timely clue to the alleged suicidal death.Erica does her best to piece together the missing years of Anna's life. She uncovers secrets about Anna's family and her relationships with various family members. Of course, Erica falls in love with a hunky intelligent policeman, but what would a story be without some form of romance.InThe Ice Princess, it would appear that all family knows more, a lot more. And most of all, what about Anna's mother? What would she know about her children that might better be kept hidden from them and the rest of the world? Is Anna's mother a victim, or a protector for family members who always seem shoved to the background.I enjoyedThe Ice Princessas a mystery. It held me suspended until the awful truth finally surfaces. What I did not enjoy was that as a story, the book was an emotional foxhole. One of the few positive events that happens is the physical and emotional love relationship between Erica and detective Patrick.In that part of the world where ice and snow preside over weather most of the year, this chilling suspense/mystery is just that. It duplicates the weather--it leaves one very cold physically and very chilled emotionally. But then I realize that not all dark stories can have a happy ending.I would recommendThe Ice Princessas a good read, only if you also surround yourself with other stories which have a more balanced, a more pleasurable ideal for the human situation. Cold climate does not necessarily mean a frigid story.Review written by Regis SchilkenAuthor of:Tears of DeceitOther Good Reads:A Foolish PluckingTo Fetch a Thief: A Chet and Bernie Mystery (Chet and Bernie Mysteries)","Regis Schilken ""Rege"""
23540,0007269854,5,Excellence in Prose,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,"[3, 4]","I don't know what it is about ""The Ice Princess"" by Camilla Lackberg that makes it so great, but for some reason, I found this impossible to put down.The story is a typical small-town whodunit in which a suspected suicide is found to be a murder.  Writer Erika, and age-old friend of the victim, and her eventual love interest, policeman Patrik, work together to solve the murder, and deal with the other issues in their lives as well.The murder is certainly at the heart of the tale, but I think that what makes this book stand out for me are the number of interesting subplots.  Erika's sister and her husband want to sell the family home, where Erika is currently living, and they have to deal with that stress, as well as the fact that the sister and her husband have some serious marital disputes within themselves to deal with during the course of the narrative.  Patrik and Erika find themselves inexorably drawn to one another, and fill their time wondering how they're going to be covering up their own faults while keeping the other interested.  Erika's best friend's wife is suspicious of her husband's cheating, but should she be?Other reviewers have found these side stories to be unconvincing and plodding, taking away from the rest of the story, but I thought they were probably the best part of the entire book.  I think that they gave a definition to the characters and the town they lived in.  A definite strength of the book is that I feel like I really knew a lot about Fjellbacka (sp?), Sweden, even though this kind of small fishing and tourist town should be completely foreign to me.The murder story was just as captivating.  With plenty of well-drawn characters (although a few standard ""typical villains"" are roaming about), there's plenty to keep you interested in throughout.  Patrik and Erika have to delve into the victim's past, and learn that even though you grow up friends with someone, you never really know everything about them.  There are mysterious disappearances, other side victims, and plenty of stuff to be uncovered, which I think really helped the pacing.I thought the translation was handled pretty well.  There were times when a sentence or two didn't really flow with the paragraph, and there were a few scenes in which characters kept referring to each other by name, but I'm willing to accomodate both of those since this is, of course, a translated novel.  A darn good one at that, and one that I'm recommending to anyone with an interest in murder mysteries.",Robert D. Watson

It's Erica herself who finds Alex's body-suspended in a bathtub of frozen water, her wrists slashed. Erica is bewildered: Why would a beautiful woman who had it all take her own life?""My Thoughts:I was really hoping to like this book more than I did. And after reading that summary I was really looking forward to reading it which may have led to my disappointment. I'll have to admit that I never quite connected with the story though which led to a bit of a disappointing reading experience for me.Let's start with what I liked about the book. I really, really liked the atmosphere that the author created with this book. The descriptions of the setting, the icy cold, all fit perfectly for me as an ideal setting for a thriller. I could feel the cold while I was reading and I loved how just the atmosphere drew me into the book. The mystery was interesting and I'll admit to never having any clue as to who the killer was. The problem that I had with this book was more with never connecting to the characters. The author wrote the story from multiple viewpoints and I found it hard to transition between the characters. I found the switching viewpoints confusing and would have preferred a little more distinction between each character and their thoughts. And I never fully connected with the characters. I liked Erica and Patrik's characters but although I liked them I felt distant from them and what they were going through. The other characters were never fleshed out enough for me to really care one way or another about them. The storyline was good but it moved slowly for me. There wasn't a whole lot of suspense for me but there was a lot of foreshadowing. And I'm going to be honest and say that my dislikes might have just been me with this book. The book was translated and is written by a Swedish author which also makes me wonder if that is why I had problems connecting to the book. It could have just been that it didn't translate well. Maybe if I had read this book written in its' original language then I would have been able to enjoy it more.All in all, I found this to just be an okay read for me.

Am I critiquing the author's writing or the translator's interpretation of it?  Is it fair to judge a book using a stand-in writer as the actual author?  The answers have always been difficult for me to determine.  In this case, I think I've found the resolution.THE ICE PRINCESS is written by Swedish author Camilla L&auml;ckberg and translated by Steven T. Murray.  I checked on Murray to find out if he is a respected translator.  It turns out that he is eminent in his field, having provided translation for 21 Swedish works, 6 Danish and 2 German/Spanish.  Perhaps his best known translation (using the pseudonym of Reg Keeland) is THE GIRL WHO trilogy, the late Steig Larsson's global best selling thriller.  So I'm going out on a limb and declaring that my review will be directed at Camilla L&auml;ckberg, the author.I think the Princess is an excellent book but I have a few misgivings.  This was L&auml;ckberg's first novel and I sensed a lack of originality that new writers often display.  The characterizations, dialogue, plot constructions, and relationships were slightly formulaic.  I know from reading a L&auml;ckberg interview that she is a voracious reader of crime novels and I found traces of writing techniques used by other crime fiction writers which sometimes is indicative of a fledgling's desperate search and failure to find fresh themes and new crime scene techniques.  It wasn't a glaring shortcoming but, in my opinion, it was there.To be fair, I haven't read any of the author's books written since this one, originally published in 2003, so I can't establish if she has modified her writing style.  But, judging from the success of her newer books, my criticism might be somewhat untimely.  I hope, however, that she has pared back the wordiness, eliminated the unnecessary asides, and avoided straying from the theme.  I'll be looking at her newer works to see if she has managed to do that.There's no question about the skills of the author.  She has an enthusiastic and clear writing style.  The structure was solid, the plot was clever, and the final disclosure of the mystery was wonderfully prepared and presented.  I had no trouble in reading the book, enjoying it, and was eager to see how it all evolved.  The setting in a frigid seacoast Swedish village was realistically portrayed and added to the atmosphere of the novel.  Some of the characters were admirable and others were bottom feeders, a successful formula for any good book.I tend to be picky about my crime novels and which ones I read.  There are so many out there and, frankly, some shouldn't be.  Fortunately, Camilla L&auml;ckberg's book is one that shines and, except for my uneasiness about its wordiness, is very enjoyable.  I highly recommend it.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES","Schuyler T  Wallace ""Writer, traveler, retire..."

The plot is okay, but the writing is uninspired and amateurish. Maybe it's just the English translation that seems heavyhanded and sophomoric, almost as if it were written for the YA crowd. More than likely, however, the translator didn't have all that much to work with. Lackberg's bio indicates she embarked on novels after taking a writing course, and her lack of natural talent is obvious. Perhaps it isn't all that hard to get published in Sweden.On the upside, the peek into everyday Swedish life and culture is interesting if sometimes a little weird--as in sitting on one's mittens to avoid getting a UTI from a park bench, even though presumably fully dressed in winter clothing. (But then, maybe I missed some sort of inside joke with that one.) Lackberg's writing and characters aren't in the same class with Larssen and his fascinatingly psychotic hacker, Lisbeth Salander.

I've read Swedish crime fiction by three different authors so far, and this riveting mystery by Camilla L&auml;ckberg, set in a provincial small town replete with dark secrets that lead to tragedy, is my favorite. The protagonist is Erica Falck, a writer of literary biographies who, when she returns to her hometown, finds the body of her childhood friend frozen in a bathtub filled with ice-covered water.The intricate story, told from the viewpoints, in third person, of various characters, gradually reveals the town's shocking secrets, which have been kept hidden because of fear of what people might think. The portrayal of characters and their relationships is exquisitely detailed, so that we know exactly what these people are like, and in one case, where we're privy to the thoughts of the indolent, absurdly pompous and overbearing local police chief, hilarious. Yes, this tragic tale is frequently leavened by humor, a quality not notable in other Swedish mysteries I've read. And the humor is light, not dark and morbid as you might expect in a dark crime novel. The winter setting is appropriately chilling. There's romance, too, as Erica teams up with police detective Patrik Hedstr&ouml;m (who, refreshingly, is a stable, cheerful type, not alcoholic or depressed) to investigate the murder.I strongly recommend this book to readers who like Swedish crime fiction and to those who would enjoy a complex contemporary small-town mystery with interesting, well-portrayed characters.",Sheila L.

It starts out with the discovery of a body of a woman, an apparent suicide, discovered in a bath tub in an unheated house in a former fishing village, now a tourist goal called Fj&auml;llbacka. One of the first people on the scene, Erica Falck, was once a close friend of the deceased woman. Because Erica is an author, specializing in the biographies of famous Swedish female authors, she is asked by the dead woman's parents to write about the woman's life. However, as Erica learns about her old friend's secrets she starts to look deeper into what happened that drove them apart as young girls.The story begins with a bit of a bang but starts to drag a bit about a quarter of the way in. I don't think the characters of the police officers were particularly compelling (or even very interesting). A second death gives the story more impetus and although the answers to some mysteries are quite obvious, the ending is satisfactory.And that's it for the story, now for the audible part. David Thorn's voice is strongly British and male. His way of voicing female characters is to make them sound breathy and bland. He occasionally will apply some accent, but usually he doesn't.

She has sold over 3.5 million copies of her book there. That might not seem like much until you realize that there are just over 9 million people living in Sweden.

I read the first 100 pages in a few hours. It got off to a great and exciting start. If I hadn't been so exhausted, I felt sure that I could have finished it that night.However, I got bogged down in the middle section. There was too much side-story that didn't involve the investigation. While the characters of Patrick, the police detective and Erica, the discoverer of the body are well developed and their budding romance is fun, it distracted from the mystery. Apparently this book is the beginning of a series starring Patrick and Erica, so I understand the need to have more of their story.The ending wasn't entirely satisfactory either and the truth simply spills out without much difficulty in the last few pages. For guarding a disturbing secret so carefully for so long, everyone gives it up too easily with just a little questioning.Camilla Lackberg does create interesting and believable characters. She has a great understanding of even the so-called ""dregs of society"" and writes of them with compassion and sympathy. Each one of the characters in the story, no matter how minor, earns a good description with plenty of back story.The Ice Princess is a fairly good mystery.

23562,0007269854,5,A Disturbing Mystery,A2YEOR4XJ8N3QE,"[3, 4]","The Ice Princess by Camilla LackbergA murder or a suicide of one or perhaps two in the tiny village of Fjallbacka, Sweden is the focus of the book.  Erica Falck arrives in her home town to settle her deceased parents affairs.  She is soon immersed in intrigue, death and mystery.Ms. Lackberg crafts an intricate tale of deceit.  She provides a great deal of information about her characters by having them investigated by either her protagonist, Erica, or the secondary protagonist, Patrik, a local cop.  Her details provide plenty of clues but she does not allow resolution of the mysteries until the very end.Winston Churchill's out of context quote is an apt description of this book; ""It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.""  Just when you think you have puzzled out the solution, Ms. Lackberg throws a curve instead of a strike.This is an excellent, thought provoking, disturbing mystery that I highly recommend.",wbentrim

I was approved and I had it sent to my Kindle. Meanwhile, I had gotten a copy of the audiobook of the first book in this series (The Ice Princess) from the library. So I decided to read (or listen to) this book first. My wife and I both listened to the audiobook in the car on the way to our cottage in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan last week. We continued listening on our way back and finished it today. I'm glad that I started with this book first.The Ice Princess is a well written Swedish mystery novel. The story isn't too light, but neither is it dark and dreary. This isn't one of those mysteries with the bodies piling up all over the place and blood covering everything. No serial killers popping up in this book. The characters are believable and likable. You will have a good idea of some of what is going on fairly early in the book, but you won't be able to figure out everything until the end. The clues are there, and if you think back you will say, ""I should have caught that, too"", but you won't.I enjoyed this book and so did my wife. The translation felt very natural. The narration of the audiobook was very good.I give this book 4 Stars out of 5 and a Thumbs Up. I am looking forward to getting back to reading The Stranger, but I'm sure that I will be reading The Preacher (Book 2 in this series) soon, since I just got that from the library.",W. Mackela

23566,0007269854,4,3.5* - slow-paced yet engaging mystery,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,"[56, 62]","I am a fan of Scandinavian mysteries, and count Karin Fossum, Henning Mankell, Arnaldur Indridason, Johan Theorin, Mari Jungstedt, and Yrsa Sigundadottir, among others, as my favorite authors. Camilla Lackberg's ""The Ice Princess"" is an interesting read, though it is slow and plodding in parts. The story is set in a seemingly idyllic fishing town in Sweden, where a beautiful and reclusive young woman, Alex, is found dead in her parents' home, seemingly a suicide, with her wrists slashed in the bath-tub. Erica Falck, a biographer and Alex's childhood friend is the second person to discover the body and this sets the stage for her eventual deep involvement in the case. Together with policeman and old school friend, Patrik Hedstrom, the pair do their best to solve the mystery (independent of each other and later together) when it turns out that Alex's death was not due to suicide but murder.The story unfolds very slowly, there really is no fast-paced action here. What readers get instead is a meticulously-detailed plot with lots of twists and different story arcs, all weaved together in a fine example of story-telling. Erica is a complex character - having had a strained relationship with her mother (who apparently was indifferent to Erica), she has become very protective of her married, younger sister Anna, who is under the control of her domineering husband, Lucas. Erica shies away from serious relationships with men, which changes when she meets old school pal Patrik and they begin investigating the case informally. Patrik is the nice guy who gets along with everyone and who digs deep to get at the truth. There are many other characters in the story - beginning with the murder suspect & resident drunk Anders, Anders' mom Vera, society lady Nelly, the dead woman's wealthy husband Henrik, Erica's high school sweetheart Dan and many more.As the story unfolds, dark secrets are unearthed, revealing some very troubling and horrifying family secrets that some would prefer stay buried. I found ""The Ice Princess"" to be a satisfying read, though it could have done with better editing as some parts seemed more like ""fillers"" and only served to slow down the story. I do look forward to reading Ms. Lackberg's other novels.",Z Hayes

While her plot line sustained my interest for most of the book, Ms. Matthews made the mistake of telling, not showing her readers how great her protagonist, Sadie, really was. Her slapstick antics made her character flat, not warm or someone to which readers could truly relate. We got beaten over the head with how poor Sadie was and we were to fall in love with her for her simple, uncomplicated personality. She seemed more a fool than a lover throughout the entire book.Ms. Matthews wrote the book as if it were a screenplay. She found the right topic, just the wrong medium to convey her story. I can easily imagine Greg Kinnear as the quirky, I-must-act-or die waiter, Tavis; Mini Driver as the bumbling Sadie; Bruce Willis as the well-meaning, yet sorely misguided Gil; and Goldie Hawn as the luscious lush, Gina.

She currently hands out leaflets at a London book fair, and runs into Gil, a Hollywood producer. The two hit it off, and after talking on the phone for a couple weeks (during which she has had several more ""jobs""), he offers to send her an open-ended airplane ticket so that they can get better acquainted and see if this relationship is worth pursuing. She is in a dead end job, has no real ties, and so figures what the heck.Faster than you can say ""mush,"" she has arrived in LA, and Gil is no where to be found. At least not at the airport... he is too busy rescuing his alcoholic / drug addicted / philandering wife (from whom he has been separated for two years since she ran away with the pool boy). When Sadie discovers that not only is Gil still married, but he caters to his ex-wife's every need (and said wife plans to stay with him indefinitely), Sadie finds other living arrangements. A series of mishaps, miscommunication, and machinations on the part of his ex, Gina complicates the unconsummated relationship, while Gil tries to make it up to Sadie by buying her expensive gifts.Meanwhile, Sadie has started a job at a talent agency specializing in body doubles. There she works with up and coming actor Tavis, and after spending extra-curricular time with him and his gay roommate, assumes they are a couple (and Tavis makes no effort to steer her into a different conclusion). After helping him with a scene from ""Romeo & Juliet,"" she starts to feel a little more than friendship for him, especially after some racy kisses make her pulse to race, but he takes the time to assure her that it was acting, and they can never be more than friends. Her friendship with Tavis has Gil jealous. But does he really have a right or a reason?Matthews does a good job working with an interesting premise, though Sadie seemed a bit whiny and hard to like at times (and lets face it, good things fell into her lap with no effort a bit too often). At some point, the reader says UNCLE. How many times can Gil disappoint Sadie and expert her to turn the other cheek?

1312780,0312674643,5,4.5 Stars - I LOVED it &#9829;,ASYM7A3FSQ6Y4,"[6, 6]","&#9658;MY THOUGHTS&#9668;First about the story:Jessica is Philadelphia to find a new job. There's a job fair and she's trying to talk to as many employers as possible.Her private life is just as sad as her professional one. The guy she was in love with left her a few weeks ago. Just like that. Storm just took off to go touring with his band.Now she's in Philadelphia and out of the window of the restaurant she sees Storm in a suit walking down the street! She follows him into a coffee-shop. Only as it turns out, it's not Storm - it's Dane - and up-close he doesn't look all that much like her EX. But he's just as hot.Dane is immediately attracted to her too, but she's late for the job fair and has to leave.But she can't get a cab in the rain, so Dane offers her a ride in his Limo.That's how they meet and we notice that they're both really attracted to each other.And that's how they end up in her hotel-room later that night.Dane is a very dominant person in the bedroom - and Jessica is really turned on by that.They spend a verrrry sexy night together, but Jess is totally spooked the next morning, and she takes off without saying goodbye.A few weeks later she's starting her new job at Ranier.And guess who her new boss is?Yep - she's going to be Dane Ranier's personal assistant!After a few days of feeling very weird with this whole situation the two of them finally find a good compromise - SEX - and only SEX. No relationship - no feelings.But nothing is ever as easy as you want it to be....feelings just sometimes happen.Plus there's the little matter of Storm....I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN OF COURSE... &#9786;I don't want to spoil your reading pleasure &#9786;_________________________________________I REALLY LOVED THE BOOK!!!It was a great book!I've read all of Opal's books - and if you love EROTICA - you can just buy anything that has her name on it! You won't ever be disappointed....This one started out perfect - the perfect erotic Romance.Nothing really new - but still the perfect story: dominant rich guy meets down-on-her-luck girl - she starts working for his company - they have sex...then feelings get involved. It was really great, until the other guy showed up. I love a m&eacute;nage story as much as the next girl, but this was not really a m&eacute;nage romance :( It was just 2 guys wanting the same girl. I would've taken them both!! But that's not really what happens here.And I know I probably spoil too much when I say that Jessica ends up with one of the guys and not with both.The book starts really perfect and the very end is perfect too. But everything that starts to happen at the 50%  mark totally confused me.Maybe it's just me - I love it when I have two people who fight through whatever it is they have to fight through - and then they find their HEA. And I can totally live with a m&eacute;nage-HEA too. But this was just too weird. YES - the sex scenes were amazing and both Storm & Dane are extremely hot guys. Totally different - but both totally sexy.But I personally didn't like the way the whole 2-guys-and-a-girl-thing was handled.I don't even know why - the end was perfect again. But everything that happened before was just so totally disturbing. It didn't make any sense to me.But aside from all those - for me - totally confusing turns - I really enjoyed reading the book.Just like ALL of Opal's books, this one was perfectly written and it had the perfect amount of sex and feelings. BUT I just wish it would've been a bit longer - the end felt a bit rushed.If you like erotic romances with a girl between 2 guys (half a HEA included) -----&#62;&#62;&#62;GO AND BUY THE BOOK &#9786;","BJs Book Blog ""Bianca"""

When the truth comes out about his identity, will you be able to stay with him? The new man in your life has gotten under your skin. Can you leave him to be with the badass musician or stay with the dominate man?Jessica Long is in a new city needing to find a job since her cousin left the state and her job left with her. Her boyfriend Storm, the man that she loved and whom she believed loved her back, walked out on her one day. Now she is attending this career fair where she hopes to find a job or else she will find herself in a very bad position. Believe me, moving back with the parents after being on your own is not a good thing.Dane Ranier is this gorgeous man that seems captivated by this young woman who has confused him with another man. Could she be just toying with him and playing hard to get? Only now, Dane is drawn to her and he must find a way to be with her again. He will find a way.Before you know it, Jessica is working for Dane's company as his personal assistant. Could it be because he only wants to have sex with her? She really needs this job and will have to take it. I have no fricking clue how in the hell Jessica was able to be so close to Dane and not melt into his arms and tell him &#34;take me now.&#34; I loved how Dane was able to open up to Jessica about his younger brother Rafe and can't believe that Melanie has been secretly in love with him. I think they would make a wonderful couple.Jessica and Dane's sexual relationship had been going strong and it seems that they could have a chance. The chemistry between them is scorching HOT. However, it seemed that her dad let out where she worked and in walks Storm. I couldn't fricking believe it. The moment that Storm enveloped Jessica in his arms, it was like home. He felt like he had never left her. Now it seems that she can't resist him and one thing leads to another and the rest is history. Something happened between Dane and Jessica in Chicago and he pushes her away. It's not fair.How is Storm going to take that Jessica has been in a relationship with Dane? This was such an emotional read for me from the time when he came back. The characters were fighting, especially Jessica and Dane. I know that Dane is trying to protect Jessica, but she should be able to make her own decision. I know that Dane and Jessica said at the very beginning that it was just physical only sex, but come on. I know that they are falling in love.This is where things start getting complicated and she needs to choose who she wants. Will it be Storm or will it be Dane? Will something happen that she will not be able to choose, as her feelings seemed torn between the two of them? In the last installment of this series which is entitled Forever, I love how Storm was able to open up. I felt more connected to Storm as he talked about his past about his childhood. He opened up more about his feelings for Jessica. Then that's the book where Dane turned coldhearted and I didn't like it one bit.A couple of love scenes were very memorable. There was one where they did not even touch each other; it was just the awareness between Dane and Jessica. There was a scene where Dane just drops his towel and he is completely nude. I'm amazed that Jessica was not jumping him; I know I would. I could feel the intense chemistry. Then, there is the office scene and that was HOT, fierce, intense, passionate. I was surprised that my kindle didn't burn up. There were a couple more intense scenes but you will have to read it to find out.This story totally blew me away. As I was reading this story, the characters seemed familiar but I just couldn't place them. Then a story that Jessica told Dane reminded me where I have read these characters. If you readers have not read Unraveled, the characters have appeared in a couple of short stories by various authors in that anthology. There, you'll read a story about Jessica and Storm, and how how they met and a little bit about their love story, how it all started. It's an awesome read.This new series by Ms. Carew is totally engaging. I love Ms. Carew's writing style and the amount of passion she puts into her writing. It left me wanting more. The passion, the chemistry that these three characters have is alarming. Dane's commanding ways set Jessica on fire. Then in comes Storm and he was just as amazing as Dane. Sure he was the commanding type but he surely did know how to pleasure Jessica. This series brought so many emotions out of me--sadness and happiness. I will have to say that I'm glad no one interrupted me while I was reading this story because I think I would have bitten off their head.This amazing book, HIS TO POSSESS, is utterly hot, intense, fierce, and passionate. Ms. Carew's writing style is amazing. I will have to check out more of her books. I believe that Jessica picked the perfect man. This is a must read series!!!",Carole &#34;The Romance Reviews&#34;

Same height, bone structure, dark hair and amazing blue eyes... but up close she is finally able to see it is not him.  This chance encounter triggers an attraction that will evolve into a full love affair.  This part of the story was both amusing and titillating.The plot twists and complications that arise as our story develops continued to entertain me and provided for a very interesting read.  Dane is a character with a dominant trait and he is out to show Jessica he can provide her what she has been lacking in her previous relationship.I hesitate to say too much because I do not want to spoil the thrill of discovery for those of you who will read this story.  Just suffice that things develop to an impasse and decisions will have to be made that will alter several lives.  If you are of a sensitive nature, please be advised that a three-some will be involved here and this is erotica in the last sections of the book.I found the book entertaining although I would have preferred a more creative ending.  The ending is OK but I was hoping things would have been resolved a little bit differently after the impasse between our characters.  For a dominant, I expected more from Dane at the end.

They try and deny the attraction but it is too strong and they embark on a hot office affair where Jessica gets to explore a submissive side she had never been aware of until he came into her life. Jessica gives her body freely but her heart is still held by the man who broke it, Storm. When he comes back into her life matters become even more complicated, she wants them both but life doesn't work that way. Will she be able to decide before they both give up on her?Opal Carew is a fabulous, creative genius. His To Possess is a scorching hot read, the sex scenes are some of the best I've ever read. The boss and assistant scenarios are always very sexy and Dane and Jessica are no exception. The sexual tension is palpable and gives the beginning of the novel an air of anticipation that will keep the reader on the edge of their seat until they give in and have explosive, passionate sex. I loved every character in this book, they are well developed and easy to connect with. Dane is sexy, dominant, commanding but also has a sweet emotional side that the reader gets to see when he talks about his brother and their childhood. Jessica begins sort of awkward and nervous but transforms into a sexy vixen as she explores her submissive side. She is also caring, intelligent and carrying the baggage of a broken heart which everyone can relate to. Storm is a sexy bad boy who is free spirited, troubled and loving. I will also say I love Melanie, she didn't have a major role in the book but she is a great friend to Jessica and was a very relatable character. The plot of this novel begins simply, dominant boss/submissive assistant but it turns into a hot, crazy wild love triangle. The author really tugs at the readers heart strings with the love triangle. Storm comes back for Jessica only to find out she is having a physical relationship with someone else. His love for her will break your heart as she continues to turn to Dane. Jessica loved Storm but he walked out on her, leaving her broken and confused but when his reasons are revealed the reader has a greater understanding of the situation. They both love her and she loves both of them but who is her true love? It is really hard to tell how things will turn out for these three. If I had to choose one word to describe this book it would be shocking, the plot twists are phenomenal and will leave the reader with their jaw hanging open wondering &#34;did that really just happen?&#34;. It seems that every chapter dropped some sort of crazy bomb in the plot and it was amazing, it will keep you turning pages because you just have to find out what is going to happen next.

I read everything and a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts novel is like Shakespeare compared to this book.  I picked this book up because I loved Michael Chriton's Timeline so much.  I am facinated with the medieval ages and think the concept of someone from today's time comming in contact with the past is an intresting concept.  Unfortunately this book is not intresting in the least.  I went into the book really wanting to like it but the writing is so stiff and awkard.  The dialogue is not believable in the least.  The romance between Edward and Robyn which should be the focal point of the book is boring.  Edward is like a Ken doll, looks cute but is plastic with no personality.  I guess it doesn't matter in the end because he is not around for most of the story anyway.  If you read this book thinking you will learn something about the medieval ages you will be sorely dissappointed.  Edward doesn't talk like he's really from the medieval ages when he meets Robyn because it's a spell.  How convienent. The author didn't want to do in depth historical research so he uses spells to just explain everything away. I can't believe there are going to be two more books after this one.  If you want to read a wonderful book about the present meeting the medieval past get Timeline.  There is more action, romance, and historical accuracy in Time Line than you will ever find in Knight Errant.",Ariel Pawlak

Garcia y Robertson, Tor Books, 2001, 539 pp.Robyn Stafford, a Hollywood producer, is in England to surprise her lover Collin for his birthday, but soon finds out he's otherwise spoken for. Hiking alone on the Anglo-Welsh border, she's stunned to see a knight in shining armor appear before her. Believing he's an escapee from a Renaissance fair, they strike up a conversation during which he believes she's a 'lad' from her attire and short hair. So begins her journey through six centuries and her relationship with the knight who turns out to be 17-year-old Edward Plantagenet, Earl of March. Robyn's journey takes her through England and France during the Wars of the Roses, and she encounters her now-ex, Collin, his new wife, and friends from her own time who are different people in the 15th century into which she's been thrust, but whom she recognizes. She also makes the acquaintance of Jacquetta Woodville, who is a witch in both times, referred to as 'Weirdville' --fittingly, to those of us who know Jacque's background. Robyn survives several misadventures, is taken prisoner by Yorkist enemies and thrown in a Tower dungeon, meets feeble King Henry VI, engages in witchcraft rituals, journeys to France and Flanders, and is reunited with Edward several times on this journey, during which she's fallen in love with him. In order to save her imprisoned friends Jo and Joy, whom she'd also known in modern times, she's given a potion which allows her a brief return to the present in order to gain access to the Tower and attempt to free them. Her swift landing on a busy shoulder of the M1, on which she's forced to hitchhike in her medieval garb, is more amusing than her disconcerting 15th century sojourn. The witchery element allows her to understand medieval English and French dialect--a question that always arises in time travel, but is seldom explained, as unbelievable as this would be to a reader. The ending, as in all romances, is a happy one in which she and Edward pledge their everlasting love and begin a life together, remaining in the 15th century, which Robyn seems not to mind, as long as she's with her beloved. While the story is rich with historical details and accurate descriptions of life in the pre-penicillin and personal hygiene days of yore, the pacing is a bit slow at times, and the reader may rush ahead to see what happens next. I personally found her love for Edward to be a bit implausible, as to why a grown woman would be so taken with a 17-year-old. Edward's character, for those of us who know him as the womanizing, partying hedonist that he was, seemed molded to fit the story. Even Richard as hero would have been more believable, as this fictional Edward is just too faithful and Beta male to be true. Also, historical sticklers will lose their suspension of disbelief, knowing that Edward never married any Robyn Stafford, but perhaps suspension will be restored upon reading the sequel, LADY ROBYN. --Diana RubinoDiana Rubino is the author of 10 historical novels, several of which are set during Ricardian times.

Knight Errant reads as though it used Wiki or Encyclopedia Britannica as it's basis with a AAA travel guide thrown in for good measure. Too many references to too many things in list form, and the proofreaders were apparently on strike.An author must bring you into their fantasy and ask you to believe certain concepts. Yet with the amount of witchcraft that Robertson has written, I don't wonder they were burning so many witches at the stake. More like not enough of them. Entire noble families and even whole villages either engaged in witchcraft or were aware of and supported those who did.The lead character, Robyn, starts out loyal to a fault, right up until the point where her 17 yr old prospective lover is in reach. But she can only connect with him if she turns her back on the mother and 9 yr old child witches who have taken her in and shown her the 15th century ropes. Their castle is under siege because of Robyn's antics, and mother and child are captured by witch hunters/rapists. Turning her back on history, she doesn't hesitate to encourage the real historic characters to make decisions based on her 21st century opinions. She never hesitates to relate her 21st century experiences to 15th century inhabitants and they seem to accept it all with the same reality as learning about a land across the sea. With that being said, I did enjoy the story line and at times couldn't put the book down but I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes.Diana Gabaldon wove history around two fictional characters.

I agree with other reviewers who commented that it drags in the middle, there's too much setting, the character of Edward doesn't seem at all like his real historical self, the witchcraft is all a little bit too convenient, etc etc.  But somehow I found myself unable to put it down.I found Robyn and Edward very sympathetic and likeable characters - it's a real shame that Edward is off-stage for much of the novel.  He's only 17 - very young, but older in the Middle Ages than it is today!  The American tourist/time traveller Robyn's age is never given, but seems to be early thirties or thereabouts.  I suppose it is pretty implausible that a 17-year-old, the most eligible bachelor in England, would fall instantly and irreversibly in love with a woman so much older, who's a complete misfit in his society.  But what the heck, it's a fantasy!  Edward is everything a medieval hero should be, brave, chivalrous, courteous, romantic, loving, caring, and of course very handsome.There are arguably far too many descriptions of places, not really needed in the story, but I'm from England and I liked seeing my country described in so much detail. :)  I've been to many of the places Robertson describes, and he's extremely accurate.All in all, I found Knight Errant rather silly, when looked at dispassionately, but wildly entertaining.

His stories are typically very colourful and imaginative, full of adventures and romance, and often featuring strong female heroines. He also has a Ph. D. in History, and his stories are often historical fantasies. It would possibly seem natural for him to turn to an historical romance in the form popularized by Diana Gabaldon's novels, that is, featuring a contemporary woman transported into historical times, there to fall in love with a hunky guy from the past. So here we have _Knight Errant_, advertised as the first of a trilogy.The heroine is Robyn Stafford, a lower-level sort of producer for a Hollywood-based movie company. The book opens with her on a walking tour near the England-Wales border. She came to England to surprise her lover on his birthday, only to find out that the cad was already married. Happily, she hit it off with the man's sister, who took her in, and arranged the walking tour to fill out the time before her return flight. Suddenly, all alone in Wales, she encounters a man in armor on horseback, who claims to be Edward, Earl of March, and the son of Richard Duke of York. (Also the elder brother of the future Richard III, which hints at interesting (to say the least) future plot developments.) Robyn is at first convinced she is being made fun of, but after a while a very realistic attack convinces her that something strange indeed has occurred -- but then Edward is gone, and she's safely in her own time. However, she is fascinated by Edward, who instantly pledged his love for her, even though she's in her 30s and he's 17. Robyn's ex-lover's sister Jo is a witch, as it happens, and she agrees to see if her coven leader, the mysterious ""Widow Wydville"", can shed some light on things -- but an attempt to call Edward to the present instead sends Robyn back into the past -- to 1460, at the height of the Wars of the Roses, with Edward regarded as a traitor to the Mad King, Henry VI. Robyn is almost immediately arrested on suspicion of being a witch.Robyn manages to escape, and encounters what appear to be historical versions of her ex-lover, mutated into an honorable knight serving King Henry, and her ex-lover's sister, who is still a witch in this time. Robyn tries to establish a foothold in the past, hoping to find a witch with the power to send her back to her own time, but also hoping to once again encounter Edward. She finds herself drawn deeper into witchcraft, and deeper into the convoluted politics of the time. Naturally, she also begins to agitate (very mildly) for improved social conditions. And when she does meet Edward again, soon she is convinced that she is truly in love, and she is helping his rebellion against the corrupt lords who have been oppressing people in the name of the ineffectual King.Garcia y Robertson is a good and engaging writer, but this book didn't fully work for me. It opens fairly strongly, and finishs excitingly, but the middle third or more of the book drags terribly. Moreover, the love story between Edward and Robyn is not convincing -- partly because Edward is off stage for much of the book. Also, Garcia y Robertson takes care to address the various implausibilities of the situation, but his explanations are somewhat lame, and much of the setup is overly convenient. So -- this isn't a terrible book, but it is a disappointment, considering the source.",Richard R. Horton

I read Diana Gabaldon's first book & didn't much like it, even though most of my friends thought it was wonderful. Maybe because it was summer when I found Knight Errant, and I had been so engrossed in my own writing, that I wanted  a light hearted change of pace. I found it in Knight Errant. It's obvious that Garcia y Robertson knows his history, and his descriptions of the reality of the Middle Ages are great. I thought the heroine was endearing, and Edward very true to life, according to other books I've read about him. I promptly read the next two books in the series and liked both of them, though I wondered how Robyn could not read the history she was given. I can't think of any historical novel of the period that contains the atmosphere and sense of place this trilogy does, perhaps because we get to see the Middle Ages through 21st Century eyes.After reading the Lady Robyn series, I went on to read Firebird, American Woman, and the earlier book,Spiral Dance.",Rowena Williamson

Despite its charms, ""Knight Errant"" loses some steam over the course of its 470+ pages -- one can imagine this being a fantastic novel had the author chosen a leaner, more focused approach.Through some surprisingly logical time-travel magic, helpfully explained and abetted by some modern-day English witches, our heroine, Robyn Stafford, finds herself whisked away to 15th century England and thrust pell-mell into the Wars of the Roses.  Not only that, the ""Lady Stafford"" has instantly developed a romantic attachment to teenage Edward, Earl of March and a medieval template for future Harlequin Romance book covers.  Witchcraft, siege warfare, jousting, and other medieval delights await Robyn as she becomes more and more intertwined in the tapestry of medieval history.Despite being a fantasy, the author has done his research, as olde England comes alive.  In true Hollywood form, Robyn is a sarcastic gal, and she makes many pithy, humorous observations about medieval life . . . although she quickly sees that life in the Middle Ages has its benefits, including falling in love with a handsome future king.  (Although there are pitfalls, too, including becoming acquainted to the 15th century version of the 21st Brit with whom she had a torrid affair in L.A., only to fly to England to learn that he has a wife.  Oh, yes, his 21st century wife is also in the 15th century -- sometimes you just can't win.)Despite containing quite a few action scenes, ""Knight Errant"" seems overlong.  A large cast of characters, numerous villains and allies, and several jaunts back and forth in time are a lot to keep track of, and with Robyn as the outsider telling the story with more than a wee bit of detachment, several passages just don't seem to have any sense of urgency.  And, inexplicably, most of the villains are denied even a strong comeuppance -- the reader just wants to see some of these guys get theirs.  (Even the author acknowledges during the final passages that certain romantic events have been a long time coming.)Entertaining, to be sure, with a few laugh-out-loud moments (although not nearly as funny as other sword-and-sorcery novels, such as ""Sir Apropos of Nothing), ""Knight Errant"" is a fun read that, although long, is worth the investment of time.

BRUTAL focuses greatly on the adult's role in the harassment of a student by adding to the problem in refusing to protect the weak in the name of ""tolerance"", and/or turning a blind-eye to the torture, favoring the bully due to their popularity, athletic higharchy or family's social standing in the community.Michael Harmon did a good job addressing some very serious issues that face teens today with the at times over the top, but definitely strong and very likeable, sassy punk rock Poe; as she puts it all on the line to stand-up for what she believes in.

I am not a pessimist, but I consider myself a realist. Bullying is out there, and we just have to hope all our preparation and proactive actions will help in the long run.

Her mom is an amazing doctor who selflessly goes to South America for a year to help people, but she isn't so great at being a mother. Instead she leaves Poe with her father, the same father Poe has never met and has only spoken to a handful of times in her entire life.

Her next-door neighbor is a boy named Velveeta (really Andrew, but he really likes cheese) who seems to be the target of the worst kind bullying. She also meets a cantankerous young man named Theo who seems to subscribe to Poe's exact philosophy of anti-establishment-ness. Turns out, though, Theo is the mayor's son. You would think Theo's particular brand of politics would tick his parents off, but in reality they are just the most happy and bubbly people- nothing seems to phase them (which you would think would be super annoying, but isn't really).When Poe stops a group of the prized football players beating up Velveeta after a prank they pulled on him, she finds herself on the wrong side of the most powerful students in the school. Now Colby Morris has it in for Poe. When Poe hits his girlfriend in the face for stealing her spot on the Elite Choir, Colby thinks Velveeta did it and spreads the word that he is going to make Velveeta pay. Poe tries to seek help, but no one is listening to her (perhaps because the other times she spoke out were to protest important things like the inequality of the gym uniforms). When the football players pull Velveeta into the bathroom and beat him within an inch of his life (actually put him in the hospital), no one believes it was Colby Morris, even the teacher who heard Poe screaming and came into the bathroom to find Velveeta broken and bloody. now Poe must find a way to prove to the school it was Colby (although they already know who did it) beyond a shadow of a doubt, even if it means putting herself in danger to do it.This is a book where the characters constantly defy their stereotypes. I thought Poe's father was either going to be completely detached or totally ticked off by her constant need to ""poke the bear"" or throw injustice in people's faces, but he was supportive of her in a wonderfully constructive way. He called her out when she was being petulant for the sake of it, but he supported her when she was right that the school was created a hierarchy among the students while simultaneously touting that all students were equal. Theo and his parents were a mold-busting group too. His parents seemed fine with his obvious attempts at non-conformity, but at times they seemed a little too disconnected. I expected them to be frustrated with how his actions affected their political aspirations, but they didn't. Even Velveeta was a surprise, as a boy who would fight to protect Poe- his only friend- even if it meant getting beaten half to death and not seeking help or police protection. This story became a stereotype buster for me. No one followed their traditional roles, and while it seemed a little over the top at times, I appreciated this character creation by Harmon.The sometimes sharp language would probably make this a book best for mature junior high students through high school. This is a great book for any student to open up a dialogue about bullying and life in their own high schools. Sometimes I find myself shocked by what students share with me when they open up. In such a small school, I like to think we are super-connected to what happens with our students, but the truth is, we can't know everything. This book is proof of that. I hope you will give this story a chance and let yourself admit our flaws in order to try and fix them.","OpheliasOwn ""jh17ophelia"""

She was a baby the last time her parents were in the same room together, and now she's moving into his house.Since her mother is usually busy 24/7, Poe is used to living on her own.  It's a welcome relief to find out her father is willing to allow her a fair amount of freedom, but his neat and tidy house soon becomes her home, and she is surprised how much she enjoys it.  The shared meals and conversation aren't nearly as dreadful as she anticipated.  The major weird thing about the arrangement is that when Poe starts school at the local high school, she's not sure how to handle the fact that David Holly, her newly inherited dad, is the school counselor.Life in Benders Hollow is way different than the punk rocker life Poe is used to.  Music is her life, and leaving her band was one of the hardest things she had to do.  When her father suggests she could join the school choir and maybe even be one of their soloists, she rejects the idea as too lame to even consider.  But after some contemplation, Poe stops in to visit the music teacher.After hearing Poe's incredible voice, Mrs. Baird promises her a spot as the principal soloist.  The result of that offer is one of Poe's first experiences with just exactly how the town of Benders Hollow works.Poe soon learns that at Benders Hollow High School a select few have all the power.  Although the school brags about its tolerance and its dedication to keeping its halls bully-free, Poe soon learns that the select few can do and say anything they want - and those in authority will look the other way.Her father's odd neighbor, Velveeta, is a target for the rampant cruelty of Benders Hollow, and he provides just the reason Poe needs to stir things up a bit at her new school.If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Michael Harmon, BRUTAL is a book you won't want to miss.  His previous books, SKATE and THE LAST EXIT TO NORMAL, are excellent, but BRUTAL takes the prize in my opinion.Poe is an independent thinker, and the way she champions the underdog should be an example to us all.  She is a terrific combination of the two people who have parented her in such different ways.  Our world would be a better place if more of us reacted to injustice like Poe did.Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka ""Readingjunky""","TeensReadToo ""Eat. Drink. Read. Be Merrier."""

However, when a prank goes deadly, Poe interferes to try to make things right.What I liked most about this book is the honest look at the results of a dysfunctional home - I mean, I felt for Poe - with a mother who puts her needs and desires before her daughter's.  Poe's dad is a tad better, but he is so partly clueless....  I like that the aduls are not perfect and I like the fact that Poe, although clearly out of her element, is willing to ""try"" to make it work.The story is one of friendship and redemption - up to a point.  Poe has an interesting relationshig with Velveeta and finds herself feeling for this person and from there comes most of the basic storyline and the most interesting of the relationships.I think the strongest part of this book is the relationships - most, if not all, are seriously dysfunctinal, but yet, I found myself involved and committed in their lives.The writing is honest and down to earth and I did enjoy this book.","Tina ""Tina"""

Sassy, savvy and street smart, she is forced to live with her father in a perfect little house in a perfect little suburb giving up singing in her punk band so her doctor mother can go to South America to help ""world citizens.""  Writer, Michael Harmon, puts Poe in the impeccable Benders High School where Poe finds out their dirty little secret; the adults don't look the other way during bullying incidents- they perpetuate it.It's subtle and important distinction that Harmon explores in Brutal.  If the teachers are supporting the intimidation of some students by the popular and athletic ones, what hope is there of eliminating the problem.  Certain students are given privileges and it's those students who are the bullies.  Colby Morris is Brutal's untouchable football hero who has singled out Velveeta, a misfit of a boy who lives near Poe, for his put downs and degradations.  Poe won't allow it, and the tenacity she used to get herself kicked out of three elite Los Angeles private schools will be needed if she is going to take on the system starting with her father who is Benders High's guidance counselor.Readers will root for Poe, because of her for her inability to let go of what she knows is right.-- Reviewed by Cathy Castelli",Whatcha Reading Now?

Fiddler is in some respects the classic alpha male, but he doesn't ride roughshod over Fiora - and she'd cut him off at the knees if he tried. They have enough in common and respect and understand each other so well that the bond between them is powerful and believable, but they have enough differences over things that matter that their conflicts are powerful and believable as well. Secondary characters are vivid and fun, too. Or vivid and scary.These books are on the edge of my tolerance for gritty realism, but my tolerance is low.

I could feel his frustration with bend flare-ups, his confusion with girl problems, and most importantly his love and joy of the music. In my opinion, that&#8217;s one of the key distinguishing factor between a good YA (heck this is true for any book, but particularly for YA) and mediocre or bad YA, whether or not the audience is able to feel the emotions that the author is going for. If you&#8217;ve bought into the book to the extent that you&#8217;re riding the waves of emotion that the protagonist is feeling, then the author has done a good job. Well let me tell you, Mark Huntley Parsons has done a great job.Of course, on top of loving the characters and the writing, I also thought Parsons did a fantastic job balancing all the different story lines, thus creating a healthy medium for them to build off one another without any of them overriding Zach&#8217;s main journey (the only storyline that I wanted Parsons to come back to that he didn&#8217;t was the postcard storyline (I understand what he was getting at, but I still would have liked to come back to it)). This, coupled with Parsons excellent pacing of the book, kept me reading to the point that I started and finished the book in the same day.All in all, I really liked Road Rash. I would easily recommend it to anyone looking for a good read, particularly if they liked Tara Kelly&#8217;s Amplified, Jacob Slichter&#8217;s So You Wanna Be a Rock and Roll Star, Antony John&#8217;s Five Flavors of Dumb, or Love Maia&#8217;s DJ Rising (all fantastic books!).

When Justin, the lead singer, is seduced by the offer of studio time and fancy equipment, he succumbs, but that means that Zach gets dumped. Kyle isn't happy about the situation, but doesn't stick up for Zach, at least not very strongly.Totally bummed, Zach lasts one day working at a garden center, quitting in a fairly flamboyant manner. His dad, who got him the job, isn't very happy, but when Zach gets an offer to replace the drunken drummer for Bad Habitt, a band that's a couple notches above Sock Monkey, he's able to talk his parents into letting him go on tour for the summer.Before leaving, Zach overhears a senior saying some pretty nasty things about Kimber, Kyle's younger sister, someone Zach is into, but unaware of how deeply (at least on a conscious level). He punches out the other guy.Touring through Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Canada with five other older teens is an eye-opening experience. Zach has to learn the invisible currents between all the players, something that's not always easy. Sometimes, it comes back to bite him, but his dedication, professionalism and attention to detail aren't overlooked by the others. Unfortunately, it rubs lead singer, Brad, the wrong way. After Zach takes a song snippet that the lead guitarist, Glen wrote and creates all the tracks needed to make it a complete song, he enters it in a contest back home. It gets selected as the lead song for the CD issued by the radio station sponsoring the contest.Back home, Kimber has been completely suckered by the guy Zach punched out. He's spread rumors that it was Zach saying all the skanky stuff instead of him. It takes an unlikely intervention by one of Zach's family members to get things back on track, leading to an amazing surprise.Meanwhile, the new song doesn't sit well with Brad and when the band reaches Jackson Hole, Brad fires Zach. Glen, quits in support. As if this wasn't bad enough, Zach will have to give up a dream opportunity now that he's out of the band.Following Zach and Glen as they return home, with an interesting stop in Las Vegas, and what happens to make everything come together, kept me turning pages furiously. Mark Huntley Parsons knows drumming and music. He's woven terminology, interpersonal tension and popular music into this book so beautifully that even the most musically ignorant reader will come away both entertained and enlightened.

Plus, he and his best friend Kyle have always dreamed their band will go somewhere someday.All this makes it incredibly confusing when Kyle informs Zach that he&#8217;s out of the band, and Zach is left floundering for something to do for the summer. Zach&#8217;s dad wants him to work in landscaping, but Zach has other plans when he gets the call from a local band known as Bad Habit. Their leader, Glenn Taylor, informs Zach that Bad Habit has a summer concert tour around Montana, Wyoming, and Canada, and they need a drummer. Zach can&#8217;t wait to leave and put the hard feelings behind him.Of course, Zach isn&#8217;t leaving everyone and everything behind. He sends his parents and little sister postcards wherever he goes. And Zach is keeping up email relations with the one girl he&#8217;s afraid to admit he has feelings for: Kimber, Kyle&#8217;s little sister. Zach is hoping that time and distance may help to sort out what he feels for his ex-best friend&#8217;s younger sister, but all that is shoved to the background as Zach has to adjust to a new band. There is the co-leader and guitarist, Glenn, who happens to be an excellent songwriter; Danny on the bass; Jamie on the keyboards; and then the other co-leader and main singer, Brad, who suffers from what Zach calls LSD --- Lead Singer&#8217;s Disease.Life on the road is more than Zach could have anticipated. First, there is always the excitement of seeing whether the club the band plays at will be luxurious or a total dive. Second, personalities among the group members don&#8217;t always match up well and hushed side conversations seem to always pop up. Most importantly, though, the music rocks and when everything clicks, it clicks. During the day the band usually travels around the local sights to take everything in, but Zach finds he has plenty of time to keep up his emails with Kimber and a little side project: recording original music. Zach puts together some of Glenn&#8217;s original music and sends it off to a battle of the bands competition just to see what will happen.Five weeks into the summer tour, Zach notices that things start falling apart at the seams. Zach learns that Brad is unhappy with the fact that Glenn and Zach have been recording original music and appear to be taking over the band. Jamie reveals to Zach that while she&#8217;s in love with Glenn, he&#8217;s too focused on his music to care for anyone else. Zach and Kimber&#8217;s relationship hits a snag when she tells him she can&#8217;t trust him anymore. To make matters worse, just as the band is falling apart, Zach learns that the demo he sent into the competition was a hit and they&#8217;ve been chosen to be the opening act for a national tour. But if there&#8217;s no band to play, how can the music go on?For all of you readers out there who hold jam sessions with your friends in the garage, ROAD RASH is for you! Not only are there pages of jokes about the stupidity of drummers, but you also get an original story about life on the road for a small band trying to make it big. Although I was never part of a band, I&#8217;m willing to guess that ROAD RASH will hit close to home for anyone who has, and has struggled to make it work. Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s less glamorous than you think, but also way more fun than you could imagine. And one last question: What do you get if you cross a drummer with a gorilla?

His replacement ends up being a spoiled kid whose father is in the big leagues and has a recording studio and hook ups in the music bizz. He attempts to get a summer job, when that faithful day he gets a call from another local (and better) band looking for a new drummer. When he gets the gig, he and the new band set out across the west to play venues and tour, but being on road for summer can get to some people.

I was so intrigued on what Zach and his bandmates could do and come up with that I wish I could go and see them on tour. Zach definitely has the natural talent of a musician, and you can tell with the way Mark writes him, he himself has talent. I was never bored reading this book, I felt like I was on tour with these guys as well. I was getting annoyed with how some of the characters acted and wondered how they could spend so much time with each other and not rip each other&#8217;s throats out. But when you&#8217;re in a band I guess that&#8217;s kind of what happens, you&#8217;re always together.Zach has major skills in every aspect of music; he can play, he can feel the music, and he can create an amazing track, but will this natural talent butt heads with the other bandmates? I was rooting for this kid the entire time, to get the girl, or at least realize he wants the girl, to rock hard and become an amazing drummer. I felt it all while reading this, annoyance, love, strength, perseverance, all he wanted was to make his new band better than before.This book is definitely worth picking up.

2331659,0425253317,4,"Review: Enthralled-4 stars, A-",A17UK8F3DYF8YW,"[7, 7]","Overall Rating: 4 stars: Enjoyed - strongly recommend (A-)Originally posted at That's What I'm Talking AboutI received this book as a gift.-----The Devil's Due by Lora Leigh (Breeds series)Katie is a unique woman whose Breed DNA did not manifest until she was in her twenties. Due to this, and the imposing testing requirements of her homeland in Europe, Katie seeks asylum in the US with Callan Lyons and the US Division of Breed Affairs. Here she is a protected guest, with the notorious Devil as her body guard.Although the opening prologue was confusing, these early events do not have a big impact on the entire novella (although for readers of the series, it will probably come into play down the road). The entire story flows smoothly after the group move to the US and settle in.Katie and Devil are SO HOT together! This is the Breeds I've been missing in the last few titles. The pair are overcome by the Breed's mating hormone - and since both are Breeds, they both exhibit the signs, including insatiable lust and desire. What makes the story fun is that Devil realizes immediately that the mating hormone is being produced, even though he had thought it was just rumor prior to his own experiences. And poor Katie--she has no clue.The novella takes place within the timeline and plot of the larger Breeds series story arc. For fans of the series, there are a few clues for the overall story and some fun surprises. I feel someone new to the series could read this novella, but it would probably not be as enjoyable since there is a lot going on, and it does tie into the bigger story.Overall, The Devil's Due is a hot and sweet story of two breeds coming together. They both enjoy their mating heat and don't fight the coupling--in fact they want it, which is a refreshing change from most Breed books. There is little conflict within this story, but hints of a war brewing in the larger story arc. Things were left open ended with respect to the bigger picture.4 stars.-----The Curse of the Black Swan by Alyssa Day (League of the Black Swan prequel)Sean, half human-half fire demon, is a firefighter in Bordertown. Although it is a paranormal friendly area, being part demon isn't something accepted in town, and so Sean and his family hide their true natures.Brynn Carroll is a woman cursed to turn into a black swan and sing songs to the moon every third night. She is determined to break the curse by never falling in love. Then one night, Sean witnesses Brynn transform, and the pair hit it off immediately.The story is sweet and fun. I adore both Sean and Brynn - two lonely people who come to realize that they can be themselves and be accepted. The story follows their courtship while Sean attempts to solve the mystery as to who is starting magically enhanced fires.Without spoiling the story, my only negative is that I wish we'd been told how ""things"" transpired at the end to come to the conclusion it did. The Curse of the Black Swan is a wonderful little story, happy and sweet. I adored both the romance and mystery. Although it ties into the overall mythology of Ms. Day's new series, it can be enjoyed as a stand alone.4.5 stars-----Salvage by Meljean Brook (Iron Seas)When Georgiana and Thom married years ago, she thought he understood her desire to have a husband who stayed home. Her expectations were shattered when Thom sailed off the morning after they were married. She may have been able to forgive that one time, but his last trip has kept him away for four years (and he abandoned her while they were copulating)!Georgiana discovers Thom (whom we met briefly in Heart of Steel) badly injured and washed-up on shore near their home. She drags him back home, and together with the doctor, she nurses Thom back to health. Before she can ask Thom to leave for good, the pair are kidnapped and forced to make a daring salvage expedition.Ah... I just love Ms. Brook's world. Salvage is yet another marvelous stand alone story in her amazing Iron Seas series. Thom and Georgiana are wonderful characters, both strong as individuals, but not so much as a married pair. The reader learns so much of their situation through their individual POVs. Thom's POV is so sad. He loves and craves Georgiana; he just never figured out how to give her what she needed. And Georgiana thought she was so clear in her coversations with Thom, but it's not until the pair are held in captivity do they really talk it all out.Salvage reads with the details and descriptions usually found only in a full-length novel. The action is fairly intense and exciting; the plot is engrossing. All of the characters are well-developed and fun. It is a wonderful story about second chances. Being kidnapped and threatened with death allows Thom and Georgiana to share their feelings and passion uninhibited.4 stars-----Ecstasy Under the Moon by Lucy Monroe (Children of the Moon)Ecstasy Under the Moon is the only title in the anthology that is a new-to-me author and series. Thankfully, Ms. Monroe includes a detailed prologue; however, even with the details, I was lost for a while.Ean are bird shifters that have stayed hidden for years. The Faol are wolf shifters. There is a bad history of the Faol hurting and killing the Ean. So it comes as a great shock that the high priestess of the Ean, tells of visions that the Faol and Ean will need to merge tribes.Una and her father are not pleased with the news that emissaries of the Faol shall come to live with the Ean. However, once Una meets one of the Faol warriors, Bryant, in the Chrechte spirit realm (in her dreams), her attitude begins to change. Even her long-held fear of the Faol begins to dissipate.Ecstasy Under the Moon has a traditional fantasy feel, more so than a paranormal romance. The world-building is extremely complex and intense. I enjoy fantasies, so this did not bother me; however, if you are looking for more of a light-hearted PNR, this one may not be for you. The highland/Scottish clan setting also gave it a historical feel.I liked the easy-going nature and flow of the story after I became grounded in the world. Bryant is a noble man/wolf, and I admire what he is trying to accomplish with his Faol brethren. I enjoyed the stories of his history, which piqued my interest and left me wanting to know more. The story had a strong message of good over bad and ""never judge a book by its cover."" It never got deep, but had a solid message.There was also a bit of humor - subtle, but fun.Overall, Ecstasy Under the Moon was enjoyable. It was my first introduction to Ms. Monroe's series. Even though it is obvious that there is much to Ms. Monroe's world, and possibly several other books, I was able to enjoy this as a stand alone.3.5 stars---In conclusion, Enthralled is an extremely enjoyable anthology, especially for those that read some or all of the series represented.","Jen Twimom ""Twimom227"""

Yes, it was interesting to see how Breeds are treated in Europe rather than the US (as in all the previous other books).  But it was harder than usual to get invested in this story.

The first story ""The Devil's Due"" by Lora Leigh returned to her ""Breeds"" series (a most welcome addition as we wait for the next full length Breed's book)!  This story added a new ""wrinkle"" to possible types of Breeds!  It was quite unexpected and the problems it brought up and the solution to keep the new type of ""Breed"" safe was a very interesting story.  I would have bought this book for this story alone!  However, the other three stories were just as enjoyable.The second story, ""The Curse of the Black Swan"" by Alyssa Day was a sweet romance between a ""cursed"" human female and a half Fire Demon with a villain who added evil to the plot.  The story was a pleasure to read.The third story, ""Salvage"" by Meljean Brook included a romance and an adventure placed in a Steampunk World.  This story was the first I have read of this type of literature.  The romance started out a bit slow, but improved quickly.  As I read the story I almost held my breath trying to figure out how the hero and heroine were going to escape from the deadly villain.  It was an entertaining and suspenseful story.The fourth (and last) story was ""Ecstasy Under The Moon"" by Lucy Monroe.

2331674,0425253317,4,4.5 stars - Truth in advertising (well in 'title-ing') - this collection definitely had me 'Enthralled',A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7,"[20, 21]","Enthralled takes us a back to the familiar worlds of Lora Leigh's sensuous Breeds, Meljean Brook's steampunky Irons Seas, and to the medieval Highlands of Lucy Monroe's shapeshifting Children of the Moon, plus it introduces the brand new Bordertown world of Alyssa Day's Order of the Black Swan.  Most of the stories are nice little carve out romances that will work for newbies and fans alike - though for Leigh's having at least a passing familiarity with the Breeds is probably a good idea - and the stories were for the most part long enough to flesh out the leads so that I cared about their HEAs, which meant that Enthralled was a real winner for me.The stories (in the order that I read them)...=========================================""SALVAGE"" -from Meljean Brook's Iron Seas=========================================Salvage starts off with a bang, or rather ""four thunks"", and it takes a bullet, a kidnapping, and a decision to throw away old promises to win this great starring pair the happily-ever-after-that-wasn't as Brook delivers another wonderful mix of romance and adventure from her Iron Seas world.The characters in this series are always compelling, so it was no surprise that I loved the leads here: the clever, practical, determined, and self sufficient Georgie - and the strong, earnest, and vulnerable Thom. And I liked seeing Thom and Georgie work to salvage their marriage even as their lives are threatened, and that they are a good pair when it comes time to take the slimmest of chances to win their freedom -- her brains perfectly complement his brawn (and hidden gadgets).So, Salvage was smart, sweetly romantic yet sexy, and fun - the door scene brought a smile to my face - and best of all everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end.===================================================================================""CURSE OF THE BLACK SWAN"" - from Alyssa Day's new Order of the Black Swan series===================================================================================Day did a good job of whetting my appetite for more of her Bordertown, which sits in a dimensional rift between the human, demon and fae worlds hidden in downtown Manhatten, while delivering a spicey-sweet romance set against a serial arsonist's magically fueled attack on Bordertown.Brynn, who plans on being the last in the line of daughters cursed to turn into a swan and sing, soon finds herself breaking her own rules by agreeing to a date with firefighter Sean (who doesn't even blink an eye when witnessing her transformation) because she recognizes the loneliness behind Sean's sexy grin. And Brynn makes Sean want to break his own rules as well, because Sean also has a `curse' that he has decided not to pass on and is sure that no woman's love could survive the reveal of his secret. But pretty quickly Sean is convinced that a HEA may actually be within his reach - and Brynn may just be the one woman who can accept his hidden fiery nature.I really liked both of the leads in this story. Brynn and Sean are both sweet and they are sweet together - their shared loneliness gives them common ground and allows them to make a deeper connection that makes this romance work in the short space. And I have to say it, fire demon firefighter -- Hot stuff. I also enjoyed the little glimpse at this new world, and I am looking forward to seeing more from Bordertown.==============================================DEVIL'S DUE -  from Lora Leigh's Breeds series===============================================I am pretty sure that fan's of Leigh's Breeds aren't going to want to miss this one, because it looks like she is pulling some threads to use in future stories.For a short story, it takes a bit for Devil's Due  to get to the main pairing in the current day but I liked the prolog which recaps the series in prose and ""introduces""  Devil, ""the Grim Reaper of the Breeds"", and then moves on to touch quickly on the events surrounding the heroine Katie's rescue as a young child from a Breed facility and - I think, since I only read the Breed shorts in anthologies like this one - to lay some ground work for the future of the series with another kind of Breed.  Also there seems to be some other things in play as well with Cassandra and with a Breed who's `passing' for Lion.So there's a fair amount of story bits that are outside of the mating heat for Devil and the grown up Katie, strung in with the steamy stuff. The smexy times between Devil and Katie are as intense as you'd expect from Leigh, but for a Breed pairing they come together pretty easily, so I missed the usual build up of sensual tension from a Breed futilely trying to deny the pull of a mate and then explosively succumbing to the heat. And *in a small voice* I guess I watch too many nature shows because the description of ""knotting"" during the pair's coupling brought a really awkward picture to my mind - but hey, guess that means that Wolf Breeds >have&lt; to be cuddlers.=============================================================""ECSTASY UNDER THE MOON"" - Lucy Monroe's Children of the Moon==============================================================Monroe takes a step back to tell a story set before Dragon Moon.Wolfshifter Byrant, is working to bridge the distance between the wolfshifting Faol and the birdshifting Elan, and trying to overcome the distrust caused by a few of his brethren hunting the birdshifters to the brink of existence.  Eagle shifter Una, bears the emotional scars from her own encounter with the Faol, but walking with Byrant in the shared dreams of mates will help her to find the strength to trust in their connection.This was a pleasant little romance that gives a glimpse of the Elan on their home turf and a chance to see prince Erik with his people before he made the trek to unite the wolves and birds.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Complementary copy courtesy of my favorite author - release date June 2nd",melindeeloo
2331675,0425253317,2,Annoying narrator and missing story (AUDIBLE version),A2QHNCP25NT9JO,"[0, 0]","I got this audiobook primarily for ""Salvage, the Meljean Brook ""Iron Seas"" story, though I've liked some of Lucy Monroe's and Lora Leigh's stories. Alyssa Day was a new author to me. I very much liked Salvage and from the story perspective -- it was an interesting, romantic, and adventurous addition to the Iron Seas universe. Day's ""Curse of the Black Swan"" was a light paranormal that was nothing earth-shattering. Monroe's story was meh.The narrator did fairly well at using distinct voices and accents for each character, had reasonable pacing and good (but not over-the-top) emotion in her reading. But I could not stand her voice. It was breathy and nasal and took me out of the three stories multiple times. I plan to avoid this narrator in the future.Three stories, not four? Annoyingly, yes. Only three of the advertised stories were included in the Audible version of ""Enthralled"": the Day, Brook and Monroe stories, but not Lora Leigh's. This is only the second Audible anthology I've purchased, so I don't know if it is common for the audio version to leave out one (or more?) of the short stories or novellas in an anthology.If you want the full version of ""Enthralled"", don't waste your money on the Audible audio version.",neurondoc

It is a story of the Breeds. Main Characters are Katie O'Sullivan (an Irish woman who is an extremely recessed Breed and doesn't realize it) and Devil, a Wolf Breed we haven't really met before (at least I don't remember him from previous stories). She is Irish and apparently the laws regarding Breeds in Ireland are different...they are constantly tested for Breed DNA and forced into labs for more than a year, but no more than 5. Story really begins when she asks to leave Ireland to be protected from being forced into the labs and meets Devil who comes to rescue her. She's taken to a ranch in New Mexico and the story unfolds.I found this one a brief story and admit I was happy to see some other characters I recognized, but would have preferred to see a story of a Breed I'd already known finally mate. Gideon, Rule, Ely, Cassie, Dane, etc...I'm waiting for these stories!!!! Not as intense and in depth as other stories (for obvious reasons-short story and all) but I enjoyed it. If you haven't read any of Lora Leigh's breed series, I think you may miss a lot with this story...but it was still entertaining. I found the added perspective/culture/intro to what is going on in Europe with Eupopean Breeds and the introduction of the Breed Leader over there really kind of interesting. Wondering what Lora Leigh plans to do with that potential story line.I really liked Lucy Monroe's story! It was short compared to those I've read of hers, but I really enjoyed it a lot. I find the world she's built to be very cool. I highly recommend her other books in the Children of the Moon Series, but you can read this as a stand alone and not be lost. Bryant is a wolf shifter (Foal) that has come to the Ean people (Eagle/Raven shapeshifters) to bridge the gap between the two shifter groups. The Ean have long-hated the Foal because they were hunted by them. Among them is Una, an eagle shifter once abused by Foal that is afraid and damaged emotionally as a result. It was a sweet story to see how Bryant handles it. A good romance in my opinion.The other two authors I haven't read and plan to read theirs next. =)","Readergirl ""Readergirl"""

Was ""Devil's Due"" worth almost $10?  N.O.  Okay, okay, so it's 25% of the book, so was it worth $2.50?  Big ole N.O.  Was I pissed as all get-out when I finished it?  You better believe it!!On its own merits, the Breed story of ""Devil's Due"" is okay.  Parts of it remind me of bits & pieces of ""Soul Deep"" & other stories (not knowing what the onset of mating heat was; the ""uncomfortable"" car ride; etc...).  There is also something else I have noticed about ALL Lora Leigh stories (Breed, Nauti Boys, Sins, Nauti Girls, etc...) -- at times it seems like she's phoning it in with the sex scenes.  I know that in my former ""real life"" (aka - when I had a paying job where I was appreciated) I used to write contracts, and it got to the point I had a file with ""standard"" issues in it that I'd just cut & paste & plunk into the appropriate spots.  I often feel when I read how the man is going to make the woman ""burn brighter and hotter"" one more time, I will just have to SCREAM.  The same phrases cut across ALL of her writings and it gets annoying.  Quite frankly, there are times I wish she'd simply stick to the mythology of the different stories and just drop trying to put in ""x"" amount of sex scenes.Now that you think I'm a LL Hater -- nope, not in the least!  I will continue to purchase her stories; I'm just not thrilled with this one.  I felt it was a forced story and quite frankly, it seemed as if it was simply a back story for the foundation of whatever is coming Cassie's way.  Too much of the Breed mating/love story of Devil & Katie was interrupted by prepping & moving forward Cassie's story.  If Cassie's story isn't next (& unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be) it's just going to make the whole Breed mythology aggravating.  Too much mysticism; not enough story.  I hope this isn't a precursor of the style of the next (hopefully full length) story.","Snarky Mom ""The Snarky Mom Reads..."""

Forever enthralled...#1 New York Times bestselling author Lora Leigh returns to her sensual world of the Breeds...as one stubborn Breed meets her match, and can no longer deny her mate--or the fierce desires of her own heart.New York Times bestselling author Alyssa Day introduces the League of the Black Swan...and the dangerous game one woman plays when her family's curse dooms her to kill the man she loves.New York Times bestselling author Meljean Brook delivers a new story in her steampunk world of the Iron Seas...as a man who's lost everything returns home to find that not only is his marriage in jeopardy, but he must now fight air pirates who intend to steal his one remaining treasure--his wife.And Lucy Monroe, national bestselling author of the Children of the Moon novels...unleashes the feral passions of a werewolf on the body, mind, and soul of his prey, his lover, his lifemate.Of the four books in this anthology I read three of the series, Lora Leigh's, Alyssa Day's, and Lucy Monroe's. Of these three series the only book I was really interested in was Alyssa's. That being said I will review the three books I did read, as I haven't read Meljean's Iron Sea's series I didn't read this book so that book won't count in my review.The Devil's Due: The last Breed book left us all hanging as to what was going to happen with Jonas's daughter as well as the mysterious Breed who was tracking there every movement. So I was expecting this book to pick up where the last one left off. And it didn't. In fact I was a good couple of chapters into it when I finally figured out what was going on. Of it has the usually cast of characters, and the whole mating thing going on, but to me it didn't progress the story arc that Leigh has us all hooked on until almost the very end of the book. It was an entertaining read, but not what I wanted or was expecting for the series.Grade: BThe Curse of the Black Swan: If you haven't yet read Alyssa's new series starter The Cursed you need to. This is a fun, engaging, unusual take on the Fae, Demon, Human world and so much fun. I loved the conflict between the hero and the heroine and how they worked through their differences to achieve their HEA. I hope to see them again in other books in this series. This story delivered on the promise Day made to her readers in The Cursed in regards to the world, story, and characters. If you only read one book in this anthology read this one.Grade: AEcstasy Under the Moon: It has been so long since a book has come out in this series, that I had to think about the world, and the last book in the series. Because there was so much time between them I was more than a little lost at times, however as the story progressed it matter less and less. I enjoyed the story and it made me want to go back and re-read the other books in the series as I remembered how much I liked it. This story was simple and not overly long and had a believable resolution for me. I'm curious to see what happens next in the series.Grade: B+As I stated before I haven't read Meljean's series so I didn't read her contribution to the series as I would have no reference point for her world.

I'm surprised how closely the movie followed the book, though there are some definite changes. I felt the movie storyline was a bit clearer, but Pappano has written a heartwarming story of one woman's unconditional love that is pushed to every limit. Emilie doesn't want to lie to everyone, but she has so few choices if she wants to keep the children out of foster care--a system she knows well, and one that practically destroyed her and definitely destroyed her sister, Berry, who has become a drug addict looking for love in all the wrong places.From the moment I opened the book, I was captivated. Part of that was because I knew the story, but more of it was because I wanted to experience the characters the way the author fully intended. Pappano captured me with this romantic tale of the season. The book contains some sex scenes that weren't part of the Hallmark movie. I didn't find them necessary, since those scenes didn't have a great impact on the overall story. Nathan and Emilie's connection went deeper than their physical relationship, and with talk of God and the presence of the angel so important to how everything is resolved, that aspect of the book threw me off a bit.If you get a chance to read Season for Miracles it will touch your heart.","Cheryl C.

Part of reason I didn't really like it may be due to the fact that I already own the movie (from Hallmark Hall of Fame - I first saw it on TV), and have watched it every year since 1999. I am aware that the book came first, but I discovered it second. (This may be one of those things that you will like whichever you experienced first, I don't know.) That being said, I may have expected more from the book than the average reader has not seen the movie.The main difference between the book and the movie was it's family friendliness. The movie was very sweet and the romance was completely clean (no sex, just kissing) and could have been rated ""G"". Just a very nice, heartwarming movie that you could watch with your kids. But the book had several sex scenes in it (some of which were fairly explicit.) I know that it won't bother everyone, but it did bother me.However, whether or not you liked the book, I can almost guarantee that you will like the movie.

I really must admit that she has got to be my favorite author. I've read several of her books, and I've enjoyed every single one of them! Watch Your Back was no exception. Normally I tend to stay away from the larger books, but when it's a book by Rose, it doesn't seem to phase me a bit!I love how each book in the Romantic Suspense/Baltimore series builds on each character. Each book focuses mainly on a character or two, but you learn even more snippets about the other characters that were introduced in previous books. Even though Stevie Mezzetti and Clay Maynard were introduced early on, this book really dives into their lives and unspoken feelings for each other. I love and get irritated with Stevie's character all at one time. I love that she's so strong and independent, but it drives me nuts how stubborn and independent she is! Clay seems to be the ultimate man, every woman's dream come true, so why can't Stevie realize that he is her dream come true? I really love the characters of this series!!Watch Your Back is full of intense, nail-biting, edge-of-your seat writing that will keep you flipping the pages way past your bedtime, and incredibly late into the night! I continually felt the need to devour up the story! This one was probably one of the most action-packed stories yet!Marguerite Gavin has become the perfect fit for the Baltimore series, and I have come to trust and love her narration!

I'm just curious about what's going on with this. If anyone has some insight . . .Now, for the book . . . it took me a while to like this book because I really didn't like Stevie. I thought she was mean and ungrateful and acted like a real witch when it was unnecessary. Also, it seemed like she was putting herself and her daughter in unnecessary danger. She's a been a copy for how long, involved in multiple cases where she lost her family or saw people losing their families or had her daughter kidnapped, has been threatened multiple times within a week, but DOESN'T think they'll come after her daughter or sister who live with her? Um . . . ok, what kind of detective are you? And then, she was so horrible about actually needing protection. She was also so horrible to Clay that I never got a good feel for WHY he wanted her or liked her so badly. I don't think she spent much time on Clay's characterization. I guess we were just supposed to read the other books to find out. And if Clay's dad's house is so protected, why leave? Yes, I understand you can't stay there forever, but it wasn't even a day and they were already moving. If they just stayed in the protected house, and it talked about all these great security features, Cordy would have been fine. Multiple cops died on this case which also was just off. I understand we're led to believe that Robbie just lost it, etc., but you spend either years as the head of a crime &#34;family&#34; and have killed multiple people but you don't think killing cops is the worst thing to do? Obviously that brings more attention than anything. There just didn't seem to be any payoff. The reader is told in countless ways that Todd didn't even care about his son and the digging that Stevie was doing didn't really seem to necessitate Todd going overboard like this to hide his secrets. In the end it mostly came together but it seems too convoluted to really work. I don't know, I guess this book was pretty typical with the other Karen Rose books I've read- JD and Paige's, etc, but in the case I guess that wasn't a good thing for me this time. I was also looking forward to Stevie and Clay's story but it just didn't work for me.",Anon

But the first thing I feel like I need to point out is that you should probably read previous books first. If you haven't the sheer amount of plot lines going on and the reasoning behind them may take longer to grasp. I also need to say that if you are planning on reading previous books please don't continue reading this review as it will inevitably have spoilers. Having read nearly all of Karen Rose' books I was itching to get this latest one and as soon as it was ready to go on my Kindle I eagerly started.Stevie Mazzetti is a ballsy woman, however she is also a woman that has spent 8 years grieving the loss of her husband and son. With the killer behind bars she has a path to follow and is desperate to rectify some things. Her ex-partner turned out to be a dirty cop and as Stevie starts to dig cases up, it seems her life as well as her daughters are now in danger. The danger levels are pretty high up from early in the book and to be fair don't drop until the very end making for a fast-paced and pretty tense read.The additional characters that are involved in this story could take a while to detail, but the main player being Clay Maynard the PI who wants to protect Stevie and her kid. Clay is a great lead character and although he is the main lead in this story we see the return of many other characters from previous books. One of the things I love about the Karen Rose books is that the characters are not forgotten. They may appear frequently or just the once but you get to see glimpses of people from previous stories and how they link to the current characters. Some people may wonder how they can even work out who belongs where, but check out Karen Rose Website as there is a place there that explains the relationship between people and books (which is a bloody great idea if you ask me). Check it out as [...]Back to the story, there is a lot going on and that is by no means an understatement. There are numerous plot threads and just when you think that things are coming to a close, something else pops up. I have to say that at nearly 600 pages this is a humdinger of a book, even by KR standards. Even so, once again Karen Rose has produced a first class thriller that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. I for one will be eagerly awaiting the next book, as it seems Karen Rose is hitting the jackpot with each and every book","Best Crime Books ""Best Crime Books"""

The tension between them was palpable in the previous offerings and I was really curious to see how Karen Rose would elaborate their story.Clay is my new hero!  His patience and dedication to little Cordelia impressed me deeply. The way he drew Stevie out of her isolation and how he reacted when he thought he'd never had a common life with her was heart wrenching. Needless to say that there were some toe-curling sex scenes!Stevie was a complexer character and for me more difficult to identify with. Surely, faith dealt her a hard hand  and who am I to judge how she chose to live her life in order to cope with her immense loss?!The suspense part of the book started with a bang and just didn't falter ( more specifically, nearly never faltered). Rose chose to develop the suspense plot in two separate threads, which she joint towards the end of the book. This allowed her to keep the reader for a long time in the dark and created a lot of suspense.Although the happy end was predictable, it was rewarding. It was very nice to see that two troubled souls could find love and a common future. Why then not 5* ?Firstly, there were far too many names involved in the plot. Some of them were characters from previous books but for somebody who hasn't read the previous books or doesn't remember those main characters, this might be a problem.Secondly, the ending of the book was completely overcrowded with details that were relevant to the case on the one hand , on the other it didn't make any sense to me to be bombarded with these details towards the end of the book. I believe  the plot would have been better supported had these pieces of information been used earlier in the plot. Maybe less would have been  more in this case? This certainly would have left more space for the happy end to sink in.In any case, foe Kare Rose fans an absolute must!",Book lover
2665246,0451414101,4,"Terrific book, even if it took a while to get going",A7KQB3WGH6HT7,"[0, 1]","First, a warning.  If you've never read one of the prior books in this series, DON&#34;T start with this one.  This is the wrap-up book for the entire cast of characters and there are frequent references to prior story lines.  Can it be read as a stand-alone?  Yes, but  you will constantly be checking back to see who goes with whom, who works for whom and who is allied with whom.  I've read several of her prior books and still found myself going over a section or two to check - is this person a cop or an attorney, an equestrian or a private investigator, a detective or a computer guru........Second, the reason I gave it four stars is that (a) it took way too long to get started and (b) the delayed relationship of the two main characters caused constant, and I mean constant, re-examination.  &#34;Should I or shouldn't I&#34; gets very tiresome very quickly.When the plot finally gets going about a  third of the way in, the book really moves quickly and the plot is fascinating.

I found, though, that I was exhausted trying to keep  up with all the constantly evolving and ever tangled additional people tossed into the story line as the book progressed.  Even though SOME of  the main characters - and I suspect they were all the ones who kept reappearing from the author's other books - were important to the story line,  it seemed as though every villain had his or her own complete carload of &#34;bad-guy helpers&#34;, each of whom had further reasons for being involved...... most of which were laid out for the reader.  It became way too overwhelming to keep track of.  Some reasons for evil deeds are necessary, but this book carried history extended  details way too far.  If, indeed, this was a wrap-up of a line of crimes that had been carried thru from previous writings, then I would hope that the next book would be able  to complete itself more succinctly.",Charlii

I am always amazed how Karen Rose can weave a story with so many characters and plots so flawlessly. Most of the characters are ones we&#8217;ve met through the 15 books in this series. We have a grown up Alec Vaughn, who we first met when he was 12 in the 4th book, who now works for PI Clay Maynord who we&#8217;ve also met in previous books before. The main characters of this book are Clay and Stevie Mazzetti. They are not new character to those that have been following the series since the beginning. And we&#8217;ve gotten bits and pieces of Stevie&#8217;s tragic story in previous books.  This book finally gives us the whole story.Eight years ago Stevie&#8217;s husband and son were killed in a robbery. All these years she has thought it was as tragically simple as that. But that was so not the case. This book was one huge puzzle with so many pieces that little by little as the author allowed them to snap into place you were shocked at how complex a mess it was and how many people&#8217;s lives were affected.I&#8217;m not going to go into detail about the plot as it should be experienced while reading.

2665254,0451414101,5,Watch Your Back by Karen Rose,A1RVRHXA5ARWFV,"[0, 0]","Watch Your Back is the latest book from romantic suspense writer, Karen Rose. With many reoccurring characters, all of Rose's books are inter-related and this one allows readers to catch up with several old favorites. Suspense is definitely this author's forte. At close to 600 pages this book reads like a wild fire, fast paced and dangerous from beginning to end. Readers who love police procedural's will love the 'dirty cop' aspect of this book and those who love strong female characters will quickly fall for Stevie. A great new book from a well respected name in the genre.What I liked:I am never daunted by a book with a lot of pages. I can dive right in and know that if it took that many pages to write, it's probably going to have at least some content that I will enjoy. With a Karen Rose book, it's given that it will be a nail-biter, with a break neck pace. This author knows how to write suspense. The tension ratchets up with each chapter, taking the reader on a harrowing journey. It's hard to put down even at a long length and readers are treated to just about all the action they can stand. You have to quit reading once in awhile just to let her heart rate return to normal. Now that's good suspense!The author has written several novels that are have reoccurring characters. You can call it a series, but it doesn't really have a name. Some books are more related than others, perhaps by the setting or a group of characters that work together. Regardless of all that. I love the way Rose ties all of her books together. You never know when you might see someone you've met in another book. On the author's website there is an area that shows how each book is related, a very clever idea. I won't say this one can't be read as a stand alone because it can, but knowing how it fits in with the rest of Rose's books may help readers understand her characters better.Stevie Mazetti is a character readers who have read Rose before probably have heard of, especially in the last few novels from the author. She is a cop who has been through a lot. She lost her husband and son to a murderer, her former partner turns out to be a dirty cop and it's understandable that she has a chip on her shoulder. It's been eight years since her husband's death and she has seen a lot of action since then, as far as her job is concerned, but not her personal life. She is closed off, unrelenting emotionally. She does not want or need another man in her life. That's ultimately why she continues to push away the one man who loves her in spite of her brassy nature.Clay Maynard is an ex-marine and he carries that commanding air of authority and overall male awareness that lots of readers really enjoy. He has loved Stevie for a long time. He has made other appearances in Rose books and readers will be happy that he finally gets his own main storyline. He obviously loves Stevie and wants to protect her and her remaining daughter. But living up to the memory of a ghost is a tough business. When Stevie draws the attention of a psychopath his protective instincts take over.I really enjoyed the rush of excitement this book provided. I was on the edge of my seat a lot with this one. I found myself thinking about what was going to happen next even when I wasn't reading. That's unusual for me. I can usually drop a book and pick up back up easily, but it doesn't generally follow me. That was unexpected and interesting. A mark of a great writer and a very well written book. Of course it might have something to do with the romantic elements as well. Stevie and Clay were obviously meant for each other.What I didn't like:Stevie was a little bit fatalistic in some ways. She clearly didn't care to some extent if she was the target of a killer or not. She didn't take the precautions I would have expected of someone who had lost family members in the past. She didn't take her safety or that of her daughter seriously and that was a bit out of character from what I would expect from someone facing this kind of danger. She also shoved Clay away with every opportunity. As a romantic myself, that was slightly frustrating, but neither point took away the overall enjoyment I got out of this one.Bottom Line:If you are a lover of romantic suspense, you have to try Karen Rose. She writes her books with simple clarity and a lot of levity. The good guys may always come out on top, but how they get there is often a tortuous experience. Rose knows how to write a book that will make the hair on the back of her neck stand up and her villains are diabolical. You really gotta try this one!",Deb@Debbie's Book Bag

The book does require careful reading though, as the plot is pretty complicated with a lot of twists and turns. With all the references to things that have happened earlier, perhaps it might be easier to keep track of the plot for those who have read the earlier books, for the sake of continuity. As with any long standing series, there may a slight sense of fatigue creeping up. You know, trying to keep with all those familiar and well loved characters, especially when most of those characters also have a ton of baggage. The connections can be exhausting for a reader new to the series. Although I would love to read Deacon's story, and Kate's, perhaps a break from these familiar characters might be the way to go.

Bad book, meandering and homophobic",A1IEZLPI7LB7J8,"[1, 1]","Stevie Mazzetti has been targeted by crooked cops ever since vowing to bring down those involved in the crimes of her ex-partner. Since so many people are gunning for her, an enemy from eight years ago - Todd Robinette - decides this would be the perfect time to execute his own plans for revenge. But he didn't count on the protection provided to Stevie by Clay Maynard, the private eye who is in love with her.All of Karen Rose's books have the same problem - they are too melodramatic, and overlong by about 200 pages. But most of them have a solid, intriguing plot to make up for this. She really hit her stride with &#34;Silent Scream, &#34;You Belong To Me&#34; and &#34;No One Left To Tell&#34;, all very good romantic suspense thrillers. The first signs of weakening were with &#34;Did You Miss Me?&#34;, but she really hits rock bottom with this stinker. There is no plot here! None! Certainly not enough to justify the very long length. About the only plot twist we get involves the gender of one of the characters. Otherwise, this is completely devoid of any surprises. We know from the get-go who the villian is. We know their flimsy motive. We know they were more than likely behind the murder of Stevie's family eight years ago.There are a lot of unanswered questions. Why does Robinette waste so much time in sending his lackeys out after Stevie? He obviously never heard the phrase &#34;too many cooks spoil the broth&#34;. Why is Clay so dedicated to having Stevie in his life? She's more than a bit of a pain. About 65% of the novel is taken up with the arguments they have with each other. Yes, this is a romantic suspense novel, but shouldn't there also be a bit of suspense? None to be found here. I never once felt that ANY of the characters were in any danger. The only fatalities are characters we don't learn anything about. This is obviously because Rose wants to bring back any character with a hint of romance in a later book.Another element that bothered me was the homophobia. Robinette is having a gay relationship on the side. Two other corrupt cops are accused of being gay. Rose suggests a direct correlation between being villianous, deceitful and immoral with being gay. The rest of the book is filled with endless moralising and martyrdom from the &#34;good&#34; characters. It really annoyed me.I could excuse so little plot in a 220-page Harlequin Intrigue novel. I can't excuse it from a 560-page behemoth like this. It took me a while to read this, and my reward was 560 pages of hackneyed drivel.The pits.",Mr. Phillips

2665307,0451414101,5,"Superb, thrilling and always entertaining!",A6W10D9F83ORV,"[1, 1]","Own the paperback.Watch Your Back is one of my 2014 favourites, and it&#8217;s even longer that the previous one, Did You Miss Me. This one is 699 pages long, and it was fabulous! One thing my friend, Suzanne, and I appreciate from Karen&#8217;s books is the length. However, I still wanted more. It&#8217;s okay, though, as there are more books to come.I have to start by saying that I adore Clay to freaking bits. This guy has the patience of a saint, and the hugest heart ever. I won&#8217;t even talk about his restraint. WOW. He totally rocks this book&#8213;as much as he rocked in the previous book&#8213;but, yeah, he&#8217;s all that and more. And, I have to say that Stevie rocks, too, even though at times I wanted to draw her a picture, or two. This purely stemmed from frustration but, trust me, you so get where she&#8217;s coming from, and you do sympathise. She is kick-arse, and tough an nails. I will also say she's damn stubborn!As per any Karen Rose book, it&#8217;s a tumultuous journey from the very first page to the last. Her work is such that it&#8217;s like consuming your favourite and most decadent meal every day for however long her stories last. There is never a boring moment, nothing ever just hangs without an explanation, and you never sit wanting to skip certain paragraphs in search of excitement. You won&#8217;t ever find anything remotely slow in these books. I cannot vouch for this author enough, and between Suzanne and myself&#8213;and we say this all the time&#8213;Karen Rose is underrated. Yes, I know she&#8217;s a Sunday Times, NYT and USA Today Bestseller, but she&#8217;s still not being bowed (best way I know how to put it!) to as she deserves. I love thrillers and romantic suspense, and I&#8217;ve read quite a few in my time, but this lady knocks it out the ballpark people, she truly does. To say I adore her work doesn&#8217;t come close to what I actually feel. I simply can&#8217;t express the amazingness.In Watch Your Back, everything that&#8217;s taken place throughout the four in the Baltimore series, comes to an awesome conclusion. The main characters in WYB are Stevie Mazetti, a cop, and Clay Maynard, a PI, who wants nothing more than to protect Stevie and her daughter, Cordelia. Stevie not only lost her husband eight years ago, but her son in the same incident. It&#8217;s bad enough losing one&#8217;s husband, but to lose one&#8217;s son is heart ripping. Stevie fights many demons, as does Clay, and has done so all these years. Unfortunately, Cordelia&#8213;poor Cordelia, she&#8217;s gone through hell for someone so young&#8213;knows and sees more than any adult gives her credit for. Kids are clever and more aware than we think. Clay adores Cordelia and the feeling is mutual, but to see how much this man feels for them both made my heart swell to humongous proportions. Sigh.It seems that past events are coming back to haunt them, and Stevie is the one who got the ball rolling. She&#8217;s investigating a few of corrupt cops, who were never implicated in certain cases, in trying to bring to justice what her former partner, Silas Dandrige, turned upside down. She&#8217;s stirred the hornet's nest, which always but always brings along trouble. On top of all of this, she has the added pressure where Clay is concerned. Oh, she tries to ignore him and his advances, and went as far as to tell him straight to his face that she can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t ever go there&#8213;she&#8217;d think of him as second best&#8230; ouch!&#8213;but she&#8217;s not totally immune. It&#8217;s more a case of being unfaithful to Paul&#8217;s memory, and her self doubt. Maybe once Clay gets what he wants, she won&#8217;t be good enough. She&#8217;s so wrong. When these two finally come together, it&#8217;s fireworks the likes of which coloured my world. For me, this was my absolute favourite couple in all the 15 books I&#8217;ve read. They totally sizzle, but then have I mentioned that Clay is all that and rocks? Think I might have.So much goes on in this book, as with all the others, there is no way I could even touch base. I&#8217;d be writing for a couple of hours, at least. The plot threads and twists are many throughout, and when you get to a particular scene and think that a conclusion is forthcoming, boom, you&#8217;re led in another direction; unbelievable. The tenseness is palpable. So much so, I&#8217;m surprised my nails stay somewhat intact by the end. And as with every book, previous characters make an appearance here and there. I love this and mention often in my reviews that when I invest this much time in these many books, the characters become a family of sorts. We reminisce over a cup, or ten, of coffee and do so, page after page, after page. Pure bliss.Needless to say that deaths are a given, as are kidnappings. Villains, Todd Robinette in WYB, are callous, emotionally dead and have absolutely no remorse or compassion for anyone, or anything. The details and investigation procedures always grab my attention; so well done, and superbly written.Here&#8217;s the thing. Some authors can write romance well, some write the suspense well, others are brilliant at thrillers, but not all are capable of getting every aspect right. Karen Rose can, and does. Every single time. The romance factor is heating up as the series progresses, and I&#8217;m loving this. I hope it continues.To each his own, but for me, I&#8217;d almost say her stories are a work of art. Superb, thrilling, and always entertaining, down to the very last full stop.","Sandra @ Novel Review Cafe ""BookWormSans"""

2681846,0451458435,4,"An excellent, deep space opera story",AS3NNNA5DO56H,"[0, 0]","Steven Harper (Piziks) deserves kudos for his intricately-crafted future universe. Dodging the stereotypical notion that any future interstellar human civilization would be a single homogeneous political entity universally subscribing to progressive or repressive politics, Harper instead creates a vivid backdrop where the myriad worlds of humanity (and aliens) are only loosely-coupled by the telepathic abilities of the Silent.In an intriguing variation on the telepathy theme, the telepathic individuals of Harper's setting (Silent) can only communicate by entering a sort of astral plane known as The Dream"". In this mutable reality distance has no meaning and humans (and aliens) can communicate freely across the vastness of space. The problem is that this makes Silent individuals an immensely valuable commodity. Worse, the fragmented nature of the many worlds has resulted in some having high standards of sentient rights, while others have pragmatically, but ruthlessly, adopt such practices as slavery. An no slaves are more valuable than the Silent.This sets the stage for the heroes of this space opera piece, members of an organization called the Children of Irfan from the socially-progressive world of Bellerophon to have their adventure. Their mission: recover a newly-discovered and uniquely powerful Silent from a planet ruled by the Nazi-esque Empire of Human Unity. Their actions have a sense of urgency, because something is disrupting The Dream itself, and it may be linked to their quarry. If The Dream is damaged badly enough then not only will it mean the end of Silent interstellar communication, but of all sentient life!The heroic characters are mostly very richly-defined. If I have any complaint it is that the motivations of the enemy are less clearly explained and this detracts somewhat from the novel. Harper also makes a point to be broad in his choice of characters, with them coming from a variety of human ethnic backgrounds as opposed to all being white Euro-Americans as is often the case in a lot of sci-fi. He even has an excellent romance between two of the male protagonists. It is also nice the way he gives each character their own clear voice and manner of speaking, thus making conversational dialogue very easy to follow. Because the characters are all noticeably different, right down to the way they speak, it makes them more fully-realized and thus enjoyable.","Dan S. ""Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fan"""

They can 'possess' the bodies of Silent slaves thousands of light years away, and are crucial in the running of the various galactic empires.The plot revolves around two major points: a Silent being of great strength that has been recently sensed within the Dream, one who can possess the non-Silent as well; and there is also a great change taking place in the Dream, where the Silent are losing control, and a great storm of change is coming.Told with great care and filled with fascinating characters, this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.",Edward Alexander Gerster

The plot has so many twists and turns that nobody will be able to predict what happens next.  Steven Harper has created a clever concept tightened by the issue of the needs of the majority vs. the rights of one (similar to killing or exploiting instead of isolating Typhoid Mary) and weaves an exciting tale around it.

Dreamer is unusual in that it is a melding of space opera and these themes and many of the ideas that I employ in my games are coincidentally mirrored here.  All sentient minds are connected to a plane of existence called the Dream, and a few individuals can access this plane for communication, and sometimes more.The plot revolves around twin axes...the story of a young powerful dream sought by various sides, and a blight on the Dream itself.  Interesting characterization and intriguing characters add to the unusual locales, both in and out of the Dream.  In our time of tumult about such things, I was pleasantly surprised at the tenderness of a same-sex relationship as depicted in the book.There are problems with pacing, its clearly the first book in a series, and some of the action of the book feels padded, and the ending clearly is ready to ramp up to sequels.  These structural difficulties, while noticeable, do not greatly impact the enjoyment of the novel.  The ideas, worlds and milieu carry the novel successfully.Recommended.","Jvstin ""Paul Weimer"""

The start is very promising and one can only hope that the interesting story elements have a chance to grow and mature into a truly memorable series.There are several unique things in ""Dreamer"" first among them is the lead character Kendi, a deep and caring telepath of Aboriginal descent.  So many main characters who dominate most of science fiction/fantasy novels are basic wasp that it is refreshing to see a minority character used to such good effectHard core SF fans will enjoy the intriguing notion of universe where interplanetary society is held together by the telepathic skills of genetically engendered individuals, called silent.  Unfortunately most parts of the galaxy silent are slaves.Dreamer is not without it's problems however first is the often stilted dialogue.  Several times the story is told through journal entries of young Sejal however I found this to be distracting from the story line.  The more significant issue is the fact that the initial plot line is resolved halfway through the book leaving the main characters with little or nothing to do.  A secondary plot about the dream world being ripped apart by tortured children just doesn't grab the attention the way the search for Sejal did.It is fortunate that Mr. Harper's second book of the series ""Nightmare"" resolves this works structural difficulties.All in all a good book worth seeking out.","StalkingGhostBear ""collecting dust"""

2872531,054521825X,4,"A time to be born, a time to die",AMX0PJKV4PPNJ,"[2, 2]","Sally Nicholls is not a household name here in America.  She is possibly not even a name that most children's librarians, booksellers, and teachers would recognize right off the bat.  This, in spite of the fact that her previous book ""Ways To Live Forever"" was a stunning success.  Folks became quite fond of that story about a boy with a terminal disease, and I suppose they expected Ms. Nicholls to do more of the same.  That's the trouble with starting off your career with realism.  Move into fantasy and you'll find that the fantasy fans don't really know who you are and the realism fans are disgusted that you haven't produced more of the same.  Separate ""Season of Secrets"" from its predecessor, however, and what you have is a hearty little novel about a girl learning about the cruel war between the seasons, in the midst of her family's own personal tribulations.Since Molly and Hannah's mother died they've been handling it as best they could.  Their father, however, has not been handling it well.  Not a jot.  So distraught is he by the loss of his wife, in fact, that he sends his two daughters off to live with their grandparents in the country.  One night Molly is witness to a frightening vision of a man run down by a pack of dogs and a horned man on a horse.  In the ensuing days she tries to tell others, to no avail, then discovers the man in a nearby shed.  She cannot nurse or help him, but she can learn as much as she can about him and what exactly he is.  As she does, her father is drawn more and more into her life with her sister, though it takes him many tries and many mistakes before any progress can be made.  The return of her father and the eventual destruction of the man come together in such a way as to give rise to winter, and the ensuing, beautiful, spring.I've been reading so many books lately that don't give a fig for beautiful language.  Coming across Ms. Nicholls felt like a gulp of cool water then.  I wasn't two pages in when Molly let loose with the descriptive, ""Hannah is one and half years older than me, yet she takes up about one and a half million times more space.""  And later, ""My dad's shirts are always stiff and clean and white; you button him up all the way to his throat and there he is, locked up safe and going nowhere.""  I love a book that gives everyday descriptions real personality and flair.  It's the signature style of Ms. Nicholls.  It's something you can count on in every book she writes.And then there was an element to this title that I found simultaneously clever and frustrating.  Age.  Here we have a tale of two sisters, one older, one younger, and there's not a moment in this story when we've a clear sense of how old they are.  This is frustrating to a reviewer like myself since you judge how believable you find a character based, in large part, on whether or not they accurately act their age.  I would have thought that Molly was acting a bit young for her age at quite a few points in the story, except that for all I know Molly could be seven or she could be ten.  My suspicion is that Ms. Nicholls gave Molly a younger age, but then realized something.  If you write a middle grade novel for 9-12 year-olds and you make your heroine only eight years of age, children aren't going to want to read that story.  Truth be told, kids like to read about children that are older than themselves.  I don't care how many horned baddies you throw in there, the minute they realize that they're sympathizing with someone the age of their little brother or sister, they may abandon the novel tout suite.  The solution then would be to eliminate ages altogether.  A clever solution then, if a bit frustrating for those of us trying to get a firm grasp on whom these characters really are.It's such a strange novel that for a moment there you just have to wonder if this is all entirely in Molly's head.  She certainly believes that the man and the Holly King (a.k.a. the dude with the horns) are real, but might we take this book as a story that is just the wild fever dream of a girl desperately trying to recreate a strong male figure in the absence of her own father?  You can get fairly far in with this interpretation, but at some point it's just not possible anymore.  What happens here is real, to a certain extent.  For good or for ill.I've always had a bit of interest in books for children that are brave enough to meld religions in some fashion.  For example, there's ""The Dark Is Rising"" with its fingers on pagan traditions and a nod to modern Christianity (a small nod).  Better still was Pat Walsh's ""The Crowfield Curse"" which managed to work in Christianity, the older fairy worship of the hills, and the even older dark religions that came before.  ""Season of Secrets"" for its part is nothing so dark, but at the same time it isn't afraid to lead its child readers to the edge of some pretty huge questions.  The Man, as he is sometimes known, is a figure of rebirth in the spring.  So it is that Nicholls will have Molly first encounter his likeness in a church (an accurate detail, I have little doubt) and then later say things like, ""He looks like a curly haired Jesus"" later even speculating (but not questioning) that, ""he's sort of god, like Jesus."" Nicholls also draws together different old English myths with skill, reminding readers that they may have seen the horned leader of The Wild Hunt not only in books like ""The Black Cauldron"" or the aforementioned ""The Dark is Rising"" but also in stories about Woden, Odin, Herne, and even King Arthur.But the book that this reminded me the most of, both in terms of tone and subject matter, was David Almond's ""Skellig"".  In one book you've a girl who tends to an injured man with the power over nature in an abandoned shed.  In the other a boy who tends to a starving man with wings in his garage.  Of course the relationship in ""Skellig"" is mildly contentious.  ""Season of Secrets"", in contrast, feels as if it is invoking the relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"".  Not a bad comparison when you consider that in both cases you have wild nature spirits tamed, in a sense, by little British girls.  Much of this story has been seen before in some sense, but Nicholls puts her own very unique spin on the storytelling.  The result is a powerful look at love, nature, the seasons, family, and home.For ages 9-12.","E. R. Bird ""Ramseelbird"""

'Ways To Live Forever' is one of my favourite YA novels and I found this to be a disappointing follow-up, not because of the writing, but because of the subject matter. Yes, it's my old bug-bear; 'magical realism' - and in this case it really didn't work for me. I thought that the local folklore was maybe a little too localised for the book, it was a tale that I was totally unfamiliar with, so couldn't really engage with it.There is no doubt however that Sally Nicholls has a beautiful style of writing and this will not put me off reading any more of her books, in fact I'm really looking forward to the release of 'All Fall Down' in March - set in Yorkshire during the Black Death.",Lincs Reader
2872533,054521825X,4,Feel like a motherless child,A23IKWYRRH2YLR,"[0, 1]","Nicholls offers a serious, quiet book, one which might easily fit in with any number of realistic fiction novels about a young girl dealing with grief, and wraps a layer of mystery and fantasy into the pages.Molly Brooke is attempting to put on a brave face after the sudden and unexpected death of her mother. Her grieving father has shunted her and younger sister Hannah off to stay with their grandparents. Molly is full of concerns about how she'll fit in at her new school, how long she'll be staying with her grandparents, whether she'll end up in an orphanage, and if her father will ever be able to pull himself together. Amidst all of this, she finds and hides a mysterious man in the woods, who is apparently being hunted. Her family assumes that her ""imaginary friend"" isn't real, and the reader is left to guess whether the ""Green Man"" in the story is simply a coping mechanism for Molly, or in fact, a helpless pagan God who relies on Molly's help to weather the winter. Hannah is appropriately bratty for a younger sister, the grandparents are loving, yet feeling quite put-upon, and Molly's dad is nearly catatonic with grief. When another child in the neighborhood corroborates Molly's story about a ""homeless"" man in the woods, her grandparent's belated panicky reaction amused me greatly. The family's initial disbelief of her claims is well handled -- everybody's stressed to the max about the recent death in the family, Molly's always been known to be an imaginative, dreamy kid, and when she initially tells her grandparents that she's worried about this man she saw in the woods there are enough details that sound unbelievable... he can appear and disappear, he can make plants and trees grow at his touch, he's being hunted by another man on horseback... and when her grandmother goes out to where Molly claims she left him camped out, she finds nothing, so the whole family assumes that this is another symptom of Molly cracking under the stress.Months later, someone else mentions seeing him, the grandparents panic, suddenly realizing their granddaughter has been hanging out with a stranger for REAL all this time. It's not really that ""funny"" but it had me thinking, ""Well, duh!"" and reminded me of how adults often don't take kids seriously enough.With it's themes of loss, stressful family situations and hidden supernatural beings who may or may not be real, this story reminded me greatly of Skellig by David Almond. Anglophiles will be pleased to know that the book has remained largely unedited, full of British references to popular children's television programs such as Blue Peter and the like.","Madigan McGillicuddy ""Librarian"""

They are tracking her, and want to capture her and of course, study her.Without giving much away, let's just say that what she knew, and the people that she thought she knew and loved were a facade and she experiences a massive amount of betrayal in this book.What I liked about this book is that the main character has humanity.

The concept is an interesting one that I have always found intriguing since my love of superhuman beings was awakened as a child with X-Men. The author creates an exciting plot that sees Sophia Dennison emerging into a new world where her superhuman abilities are just the beginning and the saying ""Evolve...or die...."" truly is the new norm of her world.The writing was thoughtful, vivid, creative and fast-paced, keeping the reader sucked into the novel from the very first page until the last.

It's different, but executed near flawlessly.I was hooked within the first chapter and simply couldn't put my kindle down after I had started; the author starts the story with an intriguing and suspenseful tone and instantly after reading it I knew that I was going to be in for quite a ride. I feel like one factor that I should note in this review is how admirable the protagonist, Sophia Dennison, is - 'The First' is one of those few books where I could find myself really relating and connecting to the troubles that the characters have to endure and it's a big part of what made me enjoy the read so much.

The storyline is unique and full of surprises that paint a fantastical world deep into the future world.Some of the reviews focus on some of the grammatical errors found, but in reality there are not to many and at least for me it did not take away from the storyline of the novel. With that said the story has a great plot and does flow well. It also is written in a very fast pace manner and is filled with non-stop action that will captivate you from the get go.I am a big fan of the Superhero Gene and enjoyed the fact that Author, Kipjo Ewers developed Sophia Dennison as one of the main characters. You simply do not see enough female main character these days it is was a delight to finally see one take a strong solid role.

Kipjo Ewers has a gift for writing that sweeps you up in this world that is so real and tangible, but different as well, taking you to a new reality where humanity itself is on the brink of something truly life changing... whether it is for the good or the bad is the question.The novel follows FBI Agent Mark Armitage as he tries to hunt down an escaped prisoner by the name of Sophia Dennison who has undergone done distinct changes in the hours before her escape. Now as he races to find her he uncovers startling secrets that change his view of the government and humanity as a whole, leaving him struggling to due his duty and yet figure out where he is in this strange new world that has just been opened to him.Throughout the novel I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat eagerly flipping to the next page as Mark and Sophia's paths interwove and split apart, each one connected to a bigger picture that slowly unraveled as I read. The writing is crisp, clean and vivid in a wonderful way... bringing this story to life and making me feel for the characters in interesting ways. This is a fast-paced and immensely satisfying read that I would say is perfect for the type of reader who likes strong dialogue, imaginative plots that bridge the gap between the supernatural and reality.

Having now finished the book (rather quickly I might add), I can say this book does indeed have the same qualities of the super hero comics I love. In one sentence, this book is about the transformation of Sophia Dennison into a super hero and her subsequent experience on the run. The book opens with Sophia being taken away for lethal injection, but Sophia is not one to be held down by a deadly, toxic injection. The rest of the book follows Sophia's life on the run to various locations. The author, Kipjo Ewers, writes very descriptively throughout the book. He does a great job of evoking emotion. For instance, during the prison scenes, the writing is cold and matter-of-fact. The author has also put a lot of effort into making the characters feel real. The main character, Sophia is exciting to follow, and I really enjoyed seeing her work her way out of problems and explore her new powers.

Yes, this is a adult read in that it is 'real, raw and relevant.' The characters were all very well developed, colorful and well believable. This author really brought these characters to life.This author also did a good job in the look 'inside the life of the women in a hustler's life.' Not only will you see many twist and turns but most of all a emotional roller coaster ride where there was plenty of drama, anger, killing, fear, sadness and pity.

Then there was Shayna, the ultimate traitorous bitch that every good book needs, as well as the ""other Tricks"" such as Luscious and Priscilla that Alijah was messing with behind Sierras back, but then again, Sierra had Mo'.....My heart was in my throat as Sierra is describing how she sees all her homies that have already gone to Heaven.......I cannot wait for Bottom Bitch 2!! ~Teri A.

Mesmerized by his swagger, Sierra makes it her business to get him in her life and bed.  Little does she know, Alijah is feeling the same way although he is married to attorney, Shayna Jackson.  He and Shayna are drifting apart and he wants out of the marriage but he knows Shayna is not going down without a fight especially living the lifestyle that Alijah's drug dealing money brings in to the household.After going through some ups and down with Sierra, Alijah decides to make her his ""Bottom Bitch.""

The resulting scandal rocks the small Louisiana town that Faith grew up in and Guy's only son, Gray, is left to pick up the pieces.  His first order of business is to run Faith and her family out of town.  The humiliation of being forced out of her home and called ""trash"" by Gray is seared in Faith's memory.Twelve years after that traumatic night Faith returns to Prescott determined to get to the bottom of what really happened to her mother and Guy.  No longer a frightened, dirt poor teenager, Faith refuses to be run off once again by Gray.  Gray does his best to make life in Prescott impossible for Faith, but he can't deny that he's attracted to the beautiful woman who bears such a striking resemblance to her mother.I knew I was in trouble when the author described Gray's long black ponytail and diamond earring.  An unfortunate picture of Lorenzo Lamas (circa 1990's) popped into my brain and I couldn't shake it for the remainder of the story.  Every time she mentioned that darned ponytail I just started giggling.  Even given the 1997 publication date, the story and characters seemed dated.  Gray/Lorenzo is a throwback to the old bodice-ripper heroes.  If he's angry or frustrated with Faith he has no problem picking her up off the ground by her arms and shaking her or grabbing her wrists until he leaves a bruise.  Of course, once he decides to ""give in to his passion"", he grows fiercely protective of Faith.  Most of the other characters are also a bit over-the-top.  How about Gray's mother, who ""took to her bed"" for about a decade due to embarrassment?  Better yet, the wack-job sister who can't get over Daddy's abandonment?  Sigh.  The whole thing has a kind of soap-opera feel to it.Despite the transparent plot and the borderline creepy Gray/Lorenzo, I have to confess (with some embarrassment) that I did like the book.  Linda Howard can tell a story.  Between my giggling and eye-rolling (hey, I can multi-task!), I was flipping those pages to see what happened next.  There is smokin' hot sexual tension between Faith and Gray/Lorenzo, and the scene between the two in the courthouse just might be worth the price of admission!  And let's face it, there is just something appealing about the poor girl who makes good and captures the heart of the town golden boy.Some strong language and fairly descriptive sex scenes.  For readers who prefer a politically correct hero...give this one a pass.One last word about the Kindle version...it was just plain awful.  Loaded with spelling errors, garbled words and mangled sentences.  I hope the print version was in better shape.",

The who done it was very predictable for me and all the characters are actually quite crazy.  Growing up in a small town, the hero and heroine are pretty messed up and no wonder since all the adults who have influenced their upbringing are completely despicable.  Having said that, the heroine goes back to her childhood town looking for closure when she learns that the reason her life was ripped apart 12 years earlier didn't actually happen.  She was a complete innocent who was badly wronged so when she gets back there and is still treated with scorn, she tosses off the gloves and sets the wheels in motion for a more personal attack.  Although she's supposed to be independent and strong, she caves in pretty early by falling right back into her childhood emotions, most importantly loving a jerk, that being the ""hero"" who ripped her family apart and kicked her out with nothing when she was 14 years old.  Deep down he's not a bad person, but I have to say, people run off all the time and the town's and his reaction to his father's desertion is way over the top.  I guess it's because he was young and stupid at the time and was trying to protect his very undeserving mother and sister. 12 years later, when she shows up in town, he tries to drive her off again with some misguided notion he has to protect his psycho mother and sister, but his guilt doesn't let him take it to an extreme because he knows he was in the wrong.  Instead he falls into an uncontrollable lust for the heroine which all things considered would be extremely embarassing considering the catalyst for all the hatred started when his dad ran off with her mother.  While she searches for the truth, they can't seem to resist one another and of course fall in love.  The truth of what happened so long ago comes to light and in the end, all these screwed up people finally learn to start living their own lives instead of meddling in with others.  I would have liked to have seen some sort of retribution for all those characters who were completely unredeemable, but the worst offenders all got their happily ever afters and that's what contributed to only a three star rating.",A Book a Day

And I use the expression sex scenes instead of love scenes very deliberately. I cannot understand how a so called strong, modern, successful woman would even tolerate, much more fall for such an abusive man. Ok, so she was in love with him growing up - he was the young prince of her small town, gorgeous, athletic, charming. But then he literally threw her family from the house they lived in (as punishment for the transgressions of her mother, who happened to be his father's mistress), dragging them out physically in the middle of the night, with the help of some buddies from the city's police force. Years later, when the girl, now a woman, returns to the city, this despicable man once more uses his power to try to expel her again in every possible way, even making sure the local store owners will not sell her food! Still, while she is around, he decides to just jump her and check out if she takes after her slutty mother. And she goes for it, again and again!I've read other titles by Linda Howard and I understand her heroes are usually the alpha type, arrogant, forceful, etc. - not really much to my taste, but still I am able to appreciate many of her books. That was not the case with this one. This was not a love story, this couple did not love each other - she was an obsessed woman without any sense of self-esteem and he was an arrogant jerk who just wanted to enjoy a great lay.","AC ""AC"""

The book is not just senual, but also very entertaining. It's an interesting book with a strong storyline. The story takes place in the small Southern town of Prescott, Louisiana and revolves around the poor, &quot;white trash&quot; Devlins and the rich Rouillard's. Faith Devlin, daughter of the town drunk and town &quot;sleep around&quot;, has had a yearning for Gray Rouillard for as long as she could remember. But Gray is older than Faith and seems to show no interest in her. On top of that, everyone in town is aware of the fact that Faith's mother, Renee, has been having an affair with Gray's father, Guy. One night Renee and Gray run off, never to be seen again. In retaliation, Gray throws Faith and her family out of town, calling them white trash and telling them to never return to Prescott again. Twelve years later, Faith Devlin Hardy returns to Prescott, a widow and in search of answers to what happened the night her mother disappeared with Guy Roulliard. She's now a successful business woman determined to show everyone that she's not trash and that she's a respectable person. Gray, hearing of her return, makes her stay in Prescott as hard as he can, throwing his money and weight around to where she can't even shop for groceries in town. But one look at Faith and he starts having dreams and feelings for her that he doesn't want. How can he fall in love with Faith and have a relationship with her if his only purpose is to destroy her?

The stupidity of the upper-class Roulliard family accepting that their father had abandoned them with no warning, running off with a his white trash mistress, without taking any of the family money, or his car, or ever using his credit cards...how gullible does this author believe her readers to be?  No one calls the authorities, or investigates the dad's sudden disappearance, or attempts to track down the couple. Instead, they blythly believe a family friend who claims to know the escape was pre-meditated, although NO evidence exists to support his conclusion.Meanwhile, the romantic ""hero"" reacts with cruelty and rage, evicting the mistress's family from their shack in retribution.  Our heroine (daughter of the ho) is only 14 yet our hero (22 at the time) finds her sexually attractive as she shivers in her threadbare nightgown when forced by him from her home in the middle of the night.

Grabbing her by the wrists till she was in pain? Shaking her until her teeth rattled? And what did she do to deserve this behavior? Um, nothing other than existing and having the last name of Devlin. He used his social and economical power to force her to his will, and when that didn't work he used his body. I didn't find him appealing AT ALL (not even his long flowing locks and twinkling diamond earring). Every time he didn't get his way immediately he threw a tantrum like a little child. The ironic thing is Faith, the heroine, was supposed to be trash in the eyes of the entire town, but every word out of Gray's mouth made him seem like the trashy one. I could go on, but some of the other 1 star reviews say it better.The writing contained a good bit of character introspection that slowed down the pace of the story and belaboured points already quite obvious. The villain was clear to me almost from the beginning. This is a highly rated book. It's sad to me that so many women find Gray appealing simply because he was rich and good looking.

The story starts off when Faith Devlin is still a child who grew up poor and in outcast child in Prescoot, Louisiana. She has always had a crush Gray Rouillard who is apart of the town's rich family. Gray is several years older than Faith. Things get bad when Gray accusses Faith's mother disapperaing with his father. He calls Faith and her family horrible names then throws her family out of town. Several years later Faith is back. The first moment they lay eyes on each other after all those years desire flashes through them both and they both try to fight it.

Several years later Faith returned to prove that Grays father did not run away with her mother.  Gray and Faith immediately clash because he still blames Faiths mother for breaking his family up.  There is suspense and sexualy tension in the book and you'll have to read it if you want to find out about what really happened to Grays father.  Now to why I didn't like the book.First, I hated Gray.  He was a total jerk (I'm being nice with my language because I think there is a better word to describe him).  He was absolutely cruel to Faith.  He really made her life miserable.  And after they made love the first time and he made the comment that if having sex with Faiths mother had been like that no wonder his father couldn't stay away, I would have knocked him on his butt.  Then he calls her the next day like nothing ever happened and gets angry when she doesn't talk to him.  It was very hard to finish the book and I kept hoping that Gray would redeam himself.  He never really did.Second, I hated Faith just as much.  She had absolutely no back bone and let Gray treat her poorly.  Everytime she tried to stand up to him he just beat her down emotionally.It would have been a good book if the characters had been better.",Christine H.

I read and enjoy everything Linda writes and in my  opinion this one is her best effort and Gray is her most romatic hero ever.  Faith has been in love with Gray since she was a child.  Although he finds  Faith attractive, he is tortured by the fact that his beloved father ran  off with Faith's mother and neither have been heard from for years.  The  night Gray realizes his father is gone, he evicts Faith and her family from  the shack where they live on his family's land and runs them out of town.  Years later Faith returns and Gray is determined to run her off again, but  he cannot deny his attraction to her and admires the way she will not back  down from him.  In a small town where his wealthy family &quot;owns&quot;  just about everything and everyone Gray makes sure the local supermarket  and gas station will not sell to Faith so she must purchase food and gas at  a nearby town.  This from a ruthless hero who is at her doorstep 10 minutes  after she phones him for help, terrified after finding roadkill in her  mailbox.  Believe me you'll love this book. Linda also writes the best love  scenes.  The porch scene.......what can be said that already hasn't been  said about it except for the fact that it has to be one of the most erotic  love scenes ever written.

He was all things good, bright and wonderful - until the night he throws Faith and her dirt-poor family out into the streets.  Gray's father, a notorious womanizer has finally gone over the edge and left his family, disappearing into the night with his lover - none other than Faith's mother.  When Gray discovers this, he takes out his uncontrollable rage upon Faith's and the rest of her family, evicting them from Rouillard land in the middle of the night.It was a memory that was to form the rest of Faith's life.  Now she lives for only one reason, to return to Prescott and finally solved what happened to Gray's father and her mother.  No longer the small town girl from a family of white trash,  Faith has worked very hard to make something of herself.  And the time has finally come for Faith to go home.  Faith did not expect Prescott to welcome her back with open arms, and she is not disappointed. Faith is the living image of her mother and in a small town people only remember all too well her mother destroyed the Rouillard marriage.

The words that have been  imprinted in the mind of Faith Devlin for the past twelve years.  Twelve  years ago, Gray Rouillard forced her family off of his family land in the  middle of the night blaming Faith's mother  for the disappearance of  his  father, Guy  Rouillard.  After that night, Faith worked hard to make a name  and  a place for herself in the world, but always with the desire to return  home.  Her homecoming wasn't to flaunt her success, her business or the  fact that she made more of herself  than any other Devlin.  Prescott was  where she belonged, her home despite the chaos she lived through that  night.  But even more, Faith must solve the mystery of Guy Rouillard's  disappearance  and  understand what caused her mother to run away that  night.  Moving back to Prescott isn't easy however, and Gray Rouillard  tries to block her at every turn.  But neither Faith nor Gray can  understand the strong attraction that is between them.  As the story  unfolds you uncover the mystery of Guy Rouillard and appreciate the growing  relationship between Gray and Faith,.  I first saw this story two years  back and passed it off as another ""rich guy meets poor woman"" story, but  after reading it I can honestly say this story is anything but that.  Linda  Howard was able to make her characters come to life, you identify with the  feelings of Faith Devlin and you want to both slap and laugh at Gray at  times.  This is definitely not the usual romantic suspense novels I usually  read, this story had more romance than suspense.  However, there were  enough steamy moments and character development that I didn't miss the  constant tension of a suspense novel.  Great job!!

Although the book was written over a decade ago the hero Gray is still HOT HOT HOT!!!  the heroine Faith is no slouch herself. Although the tragedies that befall Faith as well as Gray shapes there lives in shades of gray, confusion, sorrow and mystery. It&iexcl;s a story that travels the road of human complexity of the heart and mind when faced with when the unimaginable, becomes reality. Faith was a mixture of young, old, wise and naive even at the age of 11 yrs old when the story first opens up. You see that she views the world through the eyes of a child when she describes in her minds eye the colors and smells that represent the people that make up her world. But with this mixture of child like innocence there is a wise spirit that is maturing underneath the surface, which becomes more evident when you see how she is the ""stability"" for her younger brother Scottie and even for her dejected, alcoholic father and brothers as well as her promiscuous mother and older sister Jodie.I read this book in less than 24 hours I couldn&iexcl;t put it down I started it at about 6pm and finished at 2:30am.

I also loved the fact that Faith was a mixture of strong, dependable, but also vulnerable and forgiving and understanding in the face of people who judged her on guilt by association and the fact that she resembled her mom. The love scenes between Faith and Gray were just hands down &iexcl;WOW&iexcl; erotic as one reviewer put it, but sensual and more realistic than some hazy, keyed up cotton candy love scene. But by far my favorite few lines in the book were when Faith reveals to Gray the fact that his dad was dead and had not abandon the family but was killed, and the fact that a big manly man like Gray laid in Faith&iexcl;s arms and cried his heart out in mourning, disillusionment and grief.I am an avid reader and this book is definitely a keeper and one that I will no doubt rediscover again one day.

So far, IMO this is her best work though I have a few other of her titles on my keeper shelf. I loved this book because the H & H were so well-developed. I grew up with them, felt their struggles and pain and Gray is so romance material yet 'real'. Howard lets him be human by not white-washing him and though some readers may be upset by the thought of the heroine still desiring him after what he did to her family, it only made Gray real rather than pandering to a romance reader's perception of what a hero ought NOT to be.The sensuality was right off the scale and Howard managed to set off fireworks everytime Gray and Faith went near each other. When they do make love, it was everything I wanted it to be. Gray was everything I wanted him to be and Faith was everything a heroine ought to be.These two characters are my favorite romance hero and heroine! The book is so well-written that no epilogue was needed (I personally dislike them as it shows me the author wasn't satisfied with her ending) but the prologue set the stage marvellously.After The Night alone makes me agree that Howard is the Queen of  Contemporary Romance. It's a pity her recent works have become more suspense than romance. I wish this trend would stop.","E. N. Ling ""Ithaca"""

After seeing over a hundred positive reviews I expected a masterpiece, and the two Howards I've read before (Son of the Morning & White Lies) had prepared me for such. Unfortunately, I didn't like this book at all. I admit that I read it for the romance and not the mystery plot, but in the end it was just the mystery that had me turning the pages. I will agree with the few others, that the way Gray treats Faith is despicable. Also, there is not a mention of why or how he fell in love with her; he just sees her and the hot blood that existed even between their parents starts to boil. He lusts Faith, loved and idolised his father and is protective of his family; that's more or less all we learn about him. Faith is more thoroughly prortraited but the fact that she wants Gray like crazy and it's mostly attributed to genes (her mother feeling the same attraction for Gray's father in the past) is not something I can stomach.I would probably categorize this book as erotica rather than romance, because of the epidermic description of the heroes feelings and hot and mindless love scenes.

Her mother and Grey's father, Guy Rouillard, have been involved for some time in a torrid affair. One night they disappear together, leaving everyone to believe that Grey had abandoned his wealth, wife, family, and position in society for the ""Devlin slut."" Grey, furious at his father's decision to leave without a word, uses his considerable influence with the local sheriff and throws eleven year-old Faith and her family out of town. Her alcoholic father abandons Faith, along with her promiscuous older sister, two rowdy older brothers and retarded baby brother while on the road. Her brothers strike out on their own and social services finally places the three remaining children with foster families. Can it get any sorrier than this??Years later, a mature, successful, absolutely gorgeous Faith returns to Prescott to find out what really happened the night her mother and Guy's father left town. She also returns to prove to the townspeople, and most of all to Guy, that she is not trash. See what I mean about predictable and perhaps, even hackneyed? There is mucho chemistry between Guy and Faith, who is just too spunky and likable for words. They are so hot they sizzle together!!

AFTER THE NIGHT is set in the small parish of Louisiana where the old-monied Rouillard family reigns supreme. At the head of the family is patriarch is Guy Rouillard, a womanizing, but doting father to his two children Gray and Monica. His wife Noelle is a self-centered southern belle, who had no problem with his cheating ways as long as he's discreet.It's a small town, therefore Guy isn't as discreet and everyone knows he's been carrying on with Renee Devlin, the whorish matriarch of the Devlin clan composed of a drunk father, two drunk sons and a daughter made in her mother's image. Then there's Faith, the only one of the family who wants more out of life (and as a child, takes care of her younger mentally disabled brother as well as the duties abandoned by her wastrel mother). Faith has loved Gray Rouillard--8-years her senior--from afar for years. One night, when it's believed her mother has run off with his father, he evicts them from their shack on his family's land (in which they lived rent free thanks to Renee's arrangement with Guy). This sets off a chain of events for Faith that ultimately land her back in Prescott 12-years later to learn what really happened that night.There's much more to the story than the synopsis I've provided, but detailing anymore would take away from story for the untold reader. Howard's storytelling is superb. She crafts a story rich in detail and well developed characters. Most of the other reviews I've read discuss how awful Gray is to Faith, but I didn't really feel it conveyed to the extreme I've seen in other reviews. There is sexual frustration between the two from when they first reunite, but it didn't jump out to me as much as I'd anticipated. This story is as much Faith's coming-of-age as it is a romance.

When I finally got a copy of it, I was so excited, saying mentally, "" this is going to be good, i know it..."" As it turns out, it's started to be good at PAGE 172 or so.I didn't know that. And while I was reading, I was asking over and over again, am I in the good part yet?"" That was the disadvantage of SOLELY relying to other ppol's opinions.  They have different tastes.Anyway, back to the novel in question...It wasn't that bad.  As I was saying, the momentum began when I was halfway through it.  I didn't like Gray that much and his change of heart towards Faith...well, let's just say that all I can see brewing up is the sexual attraction between them.  Howard added a spoonful of protectiveness in his character just so it wouldn't be completely phony...As for Faith, my goodness, wat's there to doubt? She's the most ""faithful"" heroine I ever read.  Her love for Gray never simmered through the years and she didn't let their family feud destroy her feelings for him.  The difference between their emotions is that,  Gray's affections were rooted from lust-oh okay-a bit of that protectiveness I mentioned above...and for Faith, they started as a child's innocent admiration and were strengtened as she battled poverty and her family's legacy.So there yo go, too cold for Gray and too hot for Faith and u have lukewarm, not the best comparison...but close enough.Finally, if it's Howard, then u can surely put ur money that there will be a mystery.  I thought it was a good plot, but it was very easy to guess the culprit because Howard didn't really supply us a lot of candidates.

The characters had wonderful chemistry, the storyline was well executed, and even the mystery (though the culprit was fairly apparent too me early on) was very engrossing.  However, my main complaint, the reason why I only gave this book 3 out of 5 stars were the two protagonists.  Or maybe antagonists?  Faith, I had no problem with as a person.  She was strong and capable.  But Gray...?  I think he was just a step or two beyond what would be an acceptable bad boy.  I mean, come on...how could she forgive him?  And even before that, how could she be attracted to him?  After what he did, and how he acts?  It almost weakens Faith's own character, in my opinion, that she would feel anything towards Gray.  And Gray...how could he even try to force himself on the older version of the child he once called trash and had thrown out of town in the middle of the night?  And the whole ""history repeating itself"" thing...a little hard to stomach, for me.  But hey, I'm done with my little rant, and my problems with the characters aside, this was a great book.  The unfathomable chemistry (IMO) between the 2 made for a steamy read, and so far has been one of my fav LH stories.  I just had to say it.","J. Fink ""hodgemo2"""

Thank goodness this was a library loan and I didn't spend any money on the book because I thought it was just awful.There is so much about the story that I didn't like it's hard to know where to begin. At the start of the story, 11 year-old Faith spies on Gray seducing a young woman. She is enthralled by seeing his body and is already in love with him (based purely on the fact that he's the town golden boy). This was my first clue that Faith would not be one of my favorite romance heroines. But I kept reading because so many positive recommendations (126 five-star reviews as I type), so I figured it had to get better. But just a few pages later, a 14 year old faith and her 5-year old brother (who has Down's Syndrome) are being tossed out of their home in the middle of the night. And the guy heading up that tossing is the ""hero""--a twenty-something Gray. He feel san overwhelming arousal at the sight of the young girl frantically trying to gather her belongings that he's had tossed out of the house. Instead of feeling any pity or compassion for her and her bewildered, shrieking brother, he takes out his frustration on Faith, telling her she's trash.Fast forward 12 years and a now successful Faith decides she's going to move back to the small town that she was so ignominiously thrown out of as a child because it feels like ""home"" (even though she had no friends, lived in a shack, and experienced no love from her parents or her siblings, other than the younger brother). She has also decided after all these years that she is going to find out what really happened on the night that her mother and Gray's father disappeared. Of course, Gray is predictably angry because he doesn't want his mother or sister upset that his father's former mistress has moved back to their tiny town. He wants to run Faith out of town, on the one hand, but on the other, he is so incredibly aroused by the mere sight of her that he also wants to have her before she goes.Faith, in the meantime, finds herself ""still"" in love with Gray. Yes, in fourteen years, her childhood crush on the guy who called her trash, was responsible for forcing her out of her childhood home, allowed her poor brother to be so horribly discomposed, and now wants her out of town (after he enjoys her attributes) has developed into full-blown love. And this is the crux of my problem with this book. There are no redeeming qualities in Gray. He is a self-centered, egotistical, mean-spirited, selfish man-whore.As the story progressed, I kept waiting for him to redeem himself, to grovel, to do anything that made him likable other than being rich, good-looking, and maintaining a tremendous sexual appetite. Alas, it just never happened to me.And as to the mystery of what really happened to their parents, I thought that was rather predictable. (And without spoiling the ending, I have to say, Faith's advice to Monica just sort of sickened me).I've seen this book recommended for it's ""alpha"" male and for it's rich boy/poor girl plotline, and both are the types of stories that I usually enjoy, but this book just has me scratching my head and wondering what I was missing because it just didn't work for me at all.",J.

The mother, Renee, is a bombshell who happens to be having an affair with one of the richest men in the city, Guy Rouillard. The father, Amos, is a drunk who beats his children if dinner isn't on the table when he gets home. The two oldest sons go out causing trouble every night. The youngest son has Down's syndrome and a heart ailment to boot. The oldest daughter is fast trailing in her mother's footsteps, willing to open her legs to anyone for a good time. And then there's the exception to the rule. Faith Devlin. A carbon copy of her mother with rich red hair and a body that doesn't belong on a 14-year-old girl. Faith takes on the role of mother, taking care of her younger brother, making sure dinner's on the table, and keeping their rundown home somewhat presentable. Faith has her sights set on more than what her parents have achieved. She has a crush on Guy Rouillard's son, Gray, and wants nothing more than for him to know that being a Devlin doesn't mean that she sleeps around, drinks a lot, or steals things. But when her mother runs away with Gray's father, her chance at winning him is lost. Gray's anger is all-encompassing, and in the dark of night, he kicks her family out of their home, sending them scurrying into the darkness. He has a mother and a sister to protect from his father's infidelities, and knows that the presence of the Devlins in town will only serve as a reminder. But 8 years later, Faith Devlin returns to Prescott, Louisiana. Because her mother did not run away with Guy Rouillard, and she's determined to find out what really happened...After the Night is, in a word, fantastic. Guy Rouillard can be an insensitive hero, which is the only thing keeping me from giving this book five stars, but I can see where he's coming from. His mother is more concerned with social status and keeping up appearances than in taking care of her children. Her husband's disappearance is a slap in the face, and she becomes a recluse because of it. And Guy's sister attempted suicide when she learned that her father wasn't coming home. So I'll say that Guy has some right to anger. But Faith didn't deserve to be the brunt of that anger. Faith was a good person. This is a girl who, at 14 years old, ran her home, took care of her little brother, and made sure that things ran smoothly. She stayed up late at night to make sure that everyone got home okay. She also had to live under constant scrutiny and embarrassment because of her last name, but she still managed to make something of herself. She starts a successful business, doesn't drink, and only sleeps with her husband. Besides her appearance, this girl is in no way reminiscent of Renee Devlin.But then, in small towns, it's appearances that matter. So, of course, she struggles through the townspeople treating her with disdain, being refused service in stores, or being watched like a hawk when she shops. And all the while she's trying to find out what happened to Gray's father so that he can sleep easy at night. She's a saint with putting up for him, and I loved her enough to forgive Gray for being so difficult. Which isn't to say that Gray was all bad. The way Howard describes him is sinful, and I can understand why Faith was infatuated with him.After the Night is one of those books that you're going to love or hate. If you like heroes who will do anything to protect their families, whose pride is of utmost importance, and who are ruthless in their efforts to get what they want, Gray will appeal to you. And if you like heroines who know how to take charge, fight back, and stand up for themselves, Faith is everything you need. This book isn't a traditional romance, but it is a great one, and I'll probably reread it again.","K. Hinton ""avid reader"""

He was from a rich kid from Prescott, Louisiana and she came from the otherside of the tracks, living in a run down shack with her drunken father and flirtatious mother, three brothers and sister. Gray was already in college when Faith, as an 11 year old child, would hoard pieces of information about her hero. She lived in a world of daydreams to escape from her humdrum life. Her life is turned upsidedown when at 14 years old, her mother is suspected of running away with Gray's father. Suddenly she and her remaining family are turned out of their home and driven from Prescott by Gray, who is angry about his father running away with Faith's mother.12 years later, Faith has made a life for herself, pulling herself up and out of the slums. She was accused of being trash and returns to Prescott to prove to the habitants that she is not trash and also to find out about the disappearance of Gray's father, Guy Rouillard, for she now knows that he did not run away that fateful night with her mother.As Faith investigates the disappearance of Guy Rouillard she is comes across many many stumbling blocks and many enemies. Her enemy number one is Gray Rouillard himself. When they meet again after 12 years, the mutual attraction is instant. However, Faith knows that falling for the charms of Gray will only bring her heartache and Gray wants Faith out of town at all costs as he does not want her stirring up old wounds.This was an exceptional read indeed. The tension between Gray and Faith is electrifying. You ride a roller coaster of emotions with Faith, first when she is a young child with the World on her shoulders and later when she is tracking the disappearance of Guy. Gray is mean but caring at the same time. Although he hurts Faith's feelings he is also protective towards her.

It was copyrighted in 1995, so is difficult to find on bookstore shelves nowadays, but it is definitely worth searching for (like on Amazon.com)! This book has a gripping plot line, centering around Faith Devlin, a small town girl with a poverty-stricken, outcast family. It starts twelve years before the actual story, with glimpses of young Faith's lifestyle in Prescott, Louisiana. This five chapter prologue ends with the rich boy in town (and, subsequently, Faith's love interest), Gray Rouillard, kicking her entire family out of their house, livelihood, and hometown. Why, you may ask? Because, Faith's gorgeous but unfaithful mother had supposedly run away with Gray Rouillard's father, Guy Rouillard, leaving his entire family humiliated, abandoned, and aggrieved. But, of course, Faith returns to town after establishing her own business and learning that her mother had never run away with Guy Rouillard from a fortuitous phone call. Gray Rouillard absolutely refuses to allow her to stay in the town of Prescott, however, never wishing to have a Devlin near his family again. This leaves two, clear battle lines drawn between them: Gray is determined to force her out of town. Faith is determined to stay. Unfortunately for these two, they are now adults with a very strong sexual attraction for one another, causing many scenes of sexual tension while they war. Faith secretly begins to suspect that Guy Rouillard is, in fact, dead, and starts searching for his killer in town, but fears telling Gray for a multitude of reasons, causing many problems.As the story develops, these two fall in love, face a stalker and an insane murderer, and argue from one side of Louisiana to the other. It's a real pleasure to read how these two get together, and all the fun little scenes in-between. This will definitely be a story you won't want to put down.On the down side for this book, a portion of the suspense is lost in the sexually charged scenes that fill its pages. Also, mystery is lacking, as the killer is sadly obvious from the very first few chapters. In fact, your suspect list goes down to one as soon as Guy Rouillard is reported missing!Over all, this book is one of those rare treasures that you wish will never end, even while you are devouring the pages in a rush to find out what happens. I strongly reccomend it, because I can tell you that I've read it at least five times myself, and still look forward to many more rereads!--This review taken from my homepage at [...] under My Reviews.

Faith is very strong willed and won't leave until she finds out the truth.Gray is very very male.  In general, he has respect for women but also seems to get around a lot.

3219143,0671019708,3,After the Night,A1IDBDTTXKKYMY,"[8, 9]","After the NightThis book is well written but the romance leaves something to be desired.The story begins with Faith Devlin as an 11 year old girl.  Her family is very poor and have a reputation for being ""white trash"".  Faith's mother Renee is the town tramp, her sister is also very promiscuous, her father is an abusive alcoholic, and her brothers are heading in the same direction.  She has a young mentally handicapped brother named Scottie who Faith adores.  Faith is the responsible one in the family and she has taken on the task of raising her brother Scottie.  What Faith's world really centres around is Gray Rouillard.  Although it isn't quite love, she idolizes him.  Gray's father, Guy, basically owns the town and is having an affair with Faith's mother, Renee.Three years later Faith's idolization has turned to young, unrequited love.  She is even more reliable then she was at the age of 11.  She cooks, she cleans and she tries to keep the sanity in her home.  She is also more a mother to Scottie than ever before.When Renee and Guy both disappear at the same time it is assumed that they have run away together.  Gray reacts with rage and evicts the entire Devlin family from their home in the middle of the night.  Gray finds himself aroused by the young girl,who has been dragged from her bed and is standing in her nightgown.  As Faith is leaving he tells her she is trash.Twelve years later a confident and successful Faith moves back to try to find out what really happened that aweful day.  A lot of things happen during those twelve years and I won't spoil it for everyone.  She has been in contact with her mother and knows that she never left with Guy.  She also wants to prove herself to the town that has judged her so cruelly.Gray finds out almost immediately that Faith is back and he evicts her out of his hotel. Gray is very attracted to Faith and immediately wants to sleep with her but is repulsed by the idea because he assumes she is just like her mother.  He does everything in his power to make her leave forever.  He also convinces the entire town to do the same.  This is where I find flaws with the book.  It's not really that it isn't realistic.  It very well could happen but the fact that the author is writing a romance novel and has such an unromantic hero is what bothers me.  Gray was just plain nasty and never showed one ounce of remorse.  He repeatedly physically restrained Faith, chased her when she tried to escape, sexually assaults her, throws her down and says horrific, unforgivable things to her.  She continues to be madly in love with him.  The romance was based wholly on lust.  It couldn't be more because they never had a conversation that didn't involve him trying to persuade her to leave town or convince her she was unworthy.  He was selfish, manipulative and controlling.  Let's not forget to mention the whispered four letter endearments.  It didn't change even after he realized what a wonderful person she was.  The fact that Faith still loves him despite the fact that he behaved like an #ss the whole time made me dislike Faith.  I like a good alpha male but this was way beyond that.While the book was well written and kept me turning the pages, the romance left me feeling very, very cold.","LTR ""Love to Read"""

I was reluctant because of the tone of some of the reviews here and a disappointing read of a Linda Howard historical.I liked that the story was told as it unfolded, rather than in flashbacks, which is more common in books where the h/h have a past. Telling the story this way enabled the reader to get to know the characters first hand and not through any distortion of memory.I thought Gray and Faith made a great couple. The dynamics of their relationship was so real and raw. Ideal? No. Hot and gripping? Most definately. This book goes in the keeper file and I will be re-reading it.

It is probably among her best in terms of writing.  But it is still dogged by the problems I see in all her books, which is how the hero treats the heroine, sexually, emotionally, socially and otherwise.One of the bedrock problems with the novel is how the two protagonists relate to each other. As a young child, Faith has a crush on Gray Rouillard. But later in the novel, Faith tells him it ""wasn't a crush,"" apparently intending to convey a much deeper feeling.Unfortunately, the notion that a 14 year old can have some kind of deep emotional bond with a wild college kid who barely knows she exists is ridiculous.  The notion that she would hold onto that crush into adulthood and be so affected by it after the college kid, now a mature man, attempts to bully and humiliate her when she moves back into town is offensive.  That is masochistic behavior, and speaks to a root lack of self confidence and esteem that is both sad and dangerous.  It is exactly the kind of mindset that compels women to remain in abusive relationships, and that is exactly the way Gray treats Faith.Secondly, I find it disturbing that in the pivotal scene of the novel, ""the night"" Gray Rouillard kicked Faith and her family out of their home, Gray imagines her to be like her mother, and is disgusted with himself for beng aroused by it.Well, so was I.  It's a reaction that pretty much encompasses how he views her throughout the story.  He is attracted to her despite thinking she is a terrible person because of her mother's actions, yet pursues her for sex regardless.  It's a horrifying mindset, hypocritical and misogynistic.Finally, and worst of all, is how Faith herself approaches the relationship.  She is initially seen as resistant, despite being attracted to him in the same way he had been as a child.  Gray manhandles her several times, and in one scene, when he knocks a coffee cup out of her hands, she deliberately spills it on herself rather than let the hot liquid scald him.  What kind of person deliberately burns themself rather that let their attacker take the consequences of his totally unacceptable behavior?  A woman with issues.Bottom line; despite wildly erotic scenery, some good writing, and a fairly decent mystery, the ""romance"" here is hard to stomach.  This is an abusive relationsihp, and the two leads are neither healthy nor attractive while they are in it.  I would be seriously afraid to let young men and woman read this and think it an acceptable way for a relationship to proceed.  It is not.",Maigray

Gray was such a jerk, but Howard writes the story in a way that you understand WHY he was a jerk and you like him anyway.  The hero and the heroine (Faith) each carry so much baggage that it was refreshing to see them get past it.  Many of Howard's books deal with people who are damaged by life's experiences.  In the real world, few people can get past such trauma, but Howard shows the grit and determination in her characters that make overcoming their damaged psyche's believable.  Also, as a fellow southerner, it is refreshing to read a story set in the south that is not full of stereotypical caricatures.",MaryS

At least that's what the rest of the people at Prescott like to believe. What they never know is that underneath is a girl who silently screams, ""I'm not like that!""  a girl who dreams of getting away, and a girl who fell in love with the local heartthrob - the very son of the powerful businessman Guy Rouillard whom her mother is indiscreetly sleeping with.Heir to the Rouillard fortune, Gray has it all - wealth, good looks, intelligence. But deep inside, Gray craves the affection of his mother, the ice queen who can't even bear the touch of her own children. And knowing his mother's nature, he has turned a blind eye on his father's infidelity and content himself with the fact that, for all his faults, his father truly loves him and his sister. Thus, when his father runs off with Renee Devlin, Gray's world comes crumbling down forcing him to turn his anger at the Devlin family.With the sheriff and deputies in tow, the Devlin family find themselves thrown out of the parish. Not long after, Faith's father and older brother abandons them, until Social Service finally finds them a foster home, where Faith starts a new life.Fast-forward to twelve years and Faith Devlin Hardy is back in town. Beautiful and successful, she is a far cry from the terrified girl whose spirit was crushed when the boy who she has secretly worshipped from afar as a young girl had ground her into the dirt that hot summer night. Hoping for closure so she could move on with her life, she has come prepared to face them all, only to realize the moment he comes knocking at the door that she was prepared for everything but Gray Rouillard himself. As she finally comes face to face with him, Faith realizes that despite the years, her feelings have never changed where Gray is concerned, and that the childhood infatuation has turned into an adult yearning. As for Gray, he was just as unprepared for the come back of Faith, and worse, for the desire so strong that he knows he must get her to leave town before he makes a fool of himself and hurt his family once again. Yet no matter how hard they try, the undeniable connection keeps on pulling them together.Having just recently discovered Linda Howard, I can't believe I've waited so long to pick-up one of her books. This is the third one of hers that I have read and I am now hooked. Her ability to create real-life stories with vivid characters and compelling plot is simply impressive. In this book, she has created a dark and heartfelt story about two people bonded together by one tragic night and who must uncover the truth about the past for them to find complete happiness. Faith is vividly portrayed as a woman trying to escape the stigma of her youth. Her journey from an impoverished childhood to a successful businesswoman is truly remarkable. And while Gray is your typical alpha-male, it is admirable to see his loyalty to his family and how protective he is. And although he did cause Faith to suffer, this was brought on by his grief at being abandoned by his father. And let's face it, in reality, some people become victims of circumstances. This being the case with Faith is what provides a compelling, heartbreaking and totally engrossing story.With its real-life characters, perfect Southern setting and scorching love scenes, AFTER THE NIGHT is a gripping story that is sure to keep you glued from start to finish. (I do wish that there were an epilogue though.)",Michelle888

Her father was an alcoholic who didn't support the family, and her mother was a beautiful woman who was unfortunately having an affair with Gray's dad. When Gray concluded his dad left his family for Faith's mom, Gray threw her entire family onto the street and had their personal property burned. She and her five siblings were split up and sent into foster care, never to live together again.Twelve years later, Faith is still feeling homesick. She moves back to her hometown. Gray is still very rich and still harboring a gruge. Though he is a grown man, with a successful career he continues to treat her as badly as he had when she was an innocent child stuck in circumstances out of her control. He calls her ""trash"", tells her to get out of town, and threatens to throw her out of town. He is unable to control his temper, yelling at her, physically and emotionally pushing her around. None of these scenes contain an ounce of humor or pleasure. Amist all the threats he constantly makes sexual advances upon her. She refuses his advances many times, but she still finds him physically attractive and he manages to wear her down. There is no emotional connection between them whatsoever, just maniacal lust on Gray's part.I am still in disbelief that anyone could consider this a romance. This book is filled with the most unloving behavior I've ever come across in a romance novel. Gray is absolutely hateful and for them to want sex with each other is something I find unbelievable.The writing is also very diffuclt to get through.

That's why I bought this book. I had read an excerpt of the main love scene somewhere on the net. It whetted my appetite. So I guess I am just like a Devlin.  I like trashy things. Sure the hero was annoying. Sure the Heroine was simple. Sure the mystery was non existent. It was good ol' fashioned fun I was after and that's what it delivered. Yes the ending was rushed but to tell the truth there was really nothing else left to say. So why not end it? Just like Faith, by that point I was spent anyway. As for Gray, he was a jerk.

She just has an incredible talent for writing strong characters, and After the Night is no exception.I was immediately drawn to Faith ~ the unfairness of what's happened to her in her life. How she didn't have a childhood because she was too busy trying to take care of everyone around her. How she was labeled as ""trash"" because of the actions of her family. How heartbreaking it must have been for her to take care of her little brother, Scottie, and watch him slowly fade away day after day. And through it all, she became a strong, resilient woman.Now, Gray. To be honest, I wasn't even sure if I liked Gray up until page 248. How he treated Faith as a child, and then to revisit that all over when she moved back home. How unfair it was for Gray to hate Faith as much as he did ~ punishing her for the sins of her mother (and of his father, I might add). Why? That question just keep popping into my head. Why the fierce hatred for a woman who never did anything to anybody? Like I said, I just wasn't sure I liked him. Until the boathouse. And then yowza. And then the bathroom in the courthouse. I was laughing one minute and heating up the next. Yowza again.And then to my surprise, I discovered Gray actually had a sense of humor. Under his hard exterior was a man who genuinely cared for this woman. I loved their playfulness, their joking, their passion. Once the two characters finally came together it was a wonderful, wonderful ride.Along with that was a small little murder mystery ~ which didn't really play a large part of the story, but was there nonetheless. I had this one pegged right away, so the resolution came as no surprise.All in all, I thought this was a Very Good read.

That said, ""After the Night"" definitely has these components, but some are better than others.Vulnerable heroine: The best part of this novel is the hero ""Faith."" She is strong and dignified without being oppressive. The reader gets an unusually long (about 70 page) introduction of Faith-as-a-child which is both charming, endearing and horribly sad and makes for a page-turning read. At that point, you really feel like you know Faith and you champion her tale. I found myself really admiring her! As the story continues, she maintains this strength and dignity and does a good job of standing up for herself. On the bad side, she tends to make the TSTL decisions that can drive you nuts as a reader.Good mystery: As far as just mystery plots go, this novel only deserves a two to three star. The premise is excellent but the revelation is fairly see-through. Also, the fumbling around by the characters is somewhat nonsense (three investigative visits to a certain lakehouse produces absolutely nothing, etc.). That being said as the bad point, the good point is the idea of the mystery is really very interesting, ie, Richest man in town vanishes with his white-trash sexy mistress... or did he?Alpha male hero: I'd say Gray, the hero, is fairly Alpha Male. I think sometimes writers mistake ""a@#hole"" with ""alpha."" A man can be strong, protective, intelligent and proactive withOUT being abusive, but that's just what I think. Gray crosses the line quite a bit in this novel, making it hard to love him and relate to the romance. One has to wonder what Faith sees in him.... but he does have his moments for sure. However, whether or not he redeems himself is up to you, the reader!Overall- this deserves three stars for the heroine and the fairly interesting plot.

3219180,0671019708,5,"""The Best by Linda Howard""",A3SYE6NEO8VSU0,"[1, 1]","After The Night is the best book Linda Howard haswritten.  It was first published in 1995.  The twomain characters, Faith Devlin and Gray Rouillard,were attracted to each other.  Faith was in lovewith Gray when she was eleven years old.  Theycame from two different classes.  Gray was richand Faith Devlin's family were known as white trashin the parish. The plot took place in Prescott,Louisiana.Faith Devlin was fourteen years old when the deputiesdragged Faith and her family out of their beds.  Theywere thrown outside with their belonging. Gray Rouillardtold Faith ""get out of the parish and never come back.""The Devlin's were living on Guy Rouillard's land in ashack, but not paying rent.Faith's mother Renee was a strumpet.  Guy Rouillardhad a long standing arrangement with Renee. Guy hadmany women on the side. He wasn't faithful to his wifeand certainly wasn't faithful to Renee. Gray heard hisfather and Faith's mother run off together.Twelve years later, Faith returned to Prescott.  Shewas curious as to exactly what had happened the nightwhen Guy and Renee disappeared.  Faith needed a senseof closure so that she could let go of the past.  Sheis still bitter about her past in Prescott and how thetown's people treated her.After The Night has it all--Romance, mystery, and lotsof  emotional goings on with secondary characters.  Theending was a complete surprise.  The author didn't giveany clues as to how the ending would turn out.I've read After The Night several times. Since it was onKindle's list,  I downloaded onto my kindle and read itonce again.  Reading After The Night on a kindle was somuch better than in paperback.I highly recommend After The Night.",Stars

The idea that there was a slight age difference was also a good idea becuase he couldn't reciporicate the atttraction when she was so young.  She was able to build her life and become successful.  Then she was able to move back to Prosper and present herself as the successful lady she had become.The mystery added to the story was also good although the identity of the person who committed the murder was a bit predictable.  That could be figured out from the very beginning.The chemistry between Faith and Gray was really good.  I wish it had ended a bit differently but overall it was a good read.",Sunflower

He won't allow the grocery store to sell her food (he's very powerful.) He won't allow restaurants to serve her.

It starts out as Gray kicking Faith and her family out of her house in the middle of the night with nothing because her mother had an on going affair with his father.  Everyone thought that Guy and Renee ran away together after Guy nor Renee ever came home, but that is not the truth.  Faith was only 14 at the time and couldn't do anything about it because Gray's family owned the house....then she grows up and comes back at the age of 26 and wants revenge!  Well, she really just wants to live in peace and find out what REALLY happened to Gray's father.  She had gotten in touch with her mother over the years and Renee swears that they did not run away together.  As soon as Gray sees her he is livid that she came back and does tons of things to get her to leave town.  All because of his stuck up no good mother and his waste of a sister.  I think that instead of everyone blaming Faith for something her MOTHER did, they need to be blaming Gray's mother and sister for the things that they themselves are actually doing and did.  Faith had no control over her mother's actions, but the rest of the characters in this book have control over what they do and through out the whole book they are portayed as good people when they are far from it.  Anyway, Gray and Faith end up falling in love while trying to find out about the past and what happened 12 years ago.

Gray (Grayson) Rouillard is the alpha-male demi-god torn between his enmity for the family of Faith Devlin and his potent attraction to this very beguiling creature.  What happens when Faith returns to her hometown over a decade after being run out of town by the Rouillard clan is a 3-dimensional tale (involving some very imperfect, haunted and conflicted characters) that promises to keep you hooked until the last page.

I can't understand all the women who have written reviews saying how romantic it is. Yes, in places the book is very sexy, but not in an emotionally intense loving way - in an empty, soul-destroying, obsessive way. For me, there was no excuse for the abuse of power the hero displayed, and there was no excuse for the abusive way he treated the heroine. My personal opinion is that love is about trust, respect and truly knowing another person. Uncontrollable lust is great in the short-term, but to be honest, it does not last and it isn't all that romantic either.If your best friend was married to a man who treated her like this, you would be urging her to find the strength to get away from him. How can it be justifiable to blame someone for the sins of their mother when they were only a child at the time of said sins? How can it be right to pile the blame on the female participant of the affair and pretend that the male must have been a poor bamboozled lamb, especially when he has a history of hedonistic adultery? The hero acted like a spoilt child, full of rage and prejudice against less privilaged people. Maybe it is because I come from England, where we have spent the last three hundred years fighting against the class system, that I find the term 'Trash' so objectionable. To me, anyone who would judge another person solely on the circumstances of their birth is shallow and bigoted.Now, having said all this, I'm sure there are many people who still believe that this book is fabulous and that's fine - you have every right to enjoy whatever books you want. The purpose of this review is to give warning to any other ladies who feel like me, to prevent them from buying this book and being disappointed. If you loved the caring and the deep emotional connection between hero and heroine in 'MacKenzies Mountain' or 'Shades of Twilight', you will not find what you want in this book.

Web , Roanna , and Jessie are all related by blood. Jessie and Roanna were orphaned at a young age and went to live with their wealthy grandmother. Jessie was the one who was wanted while Roanna was taken in because of a sense of family. All of her life, Roanna was made aware that in compared to Jessie she wasn't worth anything. Web was their distant cousin who was as much beloved to Grandmother Davenport as Jessie was. Grandmother Davenport even went so far as to name him as the executor of the will. Years later Jessie and Web are married. Then tragedy happens. Jessie is murdered and Web is the most obvious suspect. With the betrayal and being the main suspect Web fled from Davencourt. Roanna is the only who stayed behind but along with her cousin's death and Web's disappearance she changed from the flighty young girl to a reserved young woman devoid of any emotion of any sort. Then one day everything changed with the bringing home of Web. Suspicion still surrounded him and Roanna saw her chance to live her own life.

Howard does a tour de force bringing together this dysfunctional family with such strongly drawn characters.  With a seamless Mutli-POV (point of view) she brings them all into vivid life for the reader, making this a pleasure to read.Roanna was a gawky ugly duckling when she came to live with her wealthy grandmother in the sprawling mansion in Alabama.  Left orphan at the early age, she feels so alone.  Her beautiful, older cousin Jessie does not welcome her.  Her grandmother makes it clear she is doing her family duty, and little else.  So while the mansion was straight out of Gone With The Wind, Roanna was so very alone in the big house.  Except for her distant cousin Webb.  He showed a gentleness that won Roanna's admiration and silent love.Roanna is constantly criticized by her grandmother, never doing anything to earn her approval, a startling contracts to the loving parents who adored her unconditionally.  This mental abuse of her young spirit is only amplified by her grandmothers utter adoration of her perfect cousin Jessie.  Even when Jessie was less than perfect her grandmother excused or covered for her.  Roanna was forced to stand silently by as Webb and Jessie are paired into the ""perfect couple"", and there was little she could do, but watch as Webb married the wild, and greedy Jessie, always feeling at the back of her mind Webb deserved better.  They seemed the faerytale couple, destined to rule the Davenport fortune, until the night Jessie was found dead, and everyone blamed Webb.With everyone, but Roanna believes he killed Jessie, Webb leaves for Arizona.  Now years later, a grown up Roanna has come to bring Webb home.  Ten years has passed.  Webb is no longer the caring gentle man Roanna loved.  He is bitter, hardened.  Despite his revulsion for his so-called families betrayal, Webb is convinced by Roanna it's time to come home, take up the reins of Davenport power and finally put Jessie's death to rest.Webb comes back for two reasons - Roanna and to find out who really killed Jessie.  Only a killer does not want his secret revealed and is willing to kill again to protect himself from exposure.  It's a home with vividly drawn characters, all with their share of dark secrets.  Howard, gives you that sultry, itchy Southern charm, a cover for a multitude of sins and passions simmering just under the surface.  Roanna is a poignant character that strikes the cord in any woman who has felt less than perfect growing up.  And by the same token, Webb is the knight in shining armour, dreams for a young girl to worship.Howard uses the Mutlio-POV(point of view) so let the reader really experience these vividly created people in a way enforced ""Stepford Writing"" (Single POV) just cannot flesh out.  It's simply Howard and the genre at it's best.","Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,"""

3219211,0671019716,2,Very Mills and Boon,A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA,"[7, 8]","I started this novel with high hopes because the actual technicalities of the writing are very good. However, it soon degenerated into a ""typical"" Mills and Boon romance of earlier times. It was actually written in 1996, but even so, I thought by that time, M & B was starting to perk up a bit.I could understand Webb marrying Jessie (young, hot-blooded idiot at the time) but to watch her bad behaviour and cruelty toward a girl (Roanna) for whom he is supposed to care, and not do anything to protect her is unreal. In fact the whole family are shown to be a pack of cold-hearted, greedy jerks.Unfortunately, the heroine's character is very weak. I found it hard to believe that she HADN'T SMILED FOR TEN YEARS? And the point about her insecurity and not eating is gone over and over to the point where I wanted to slap her. No matter what the hero does, she immediately feels she's ""not worthy"" and that everyone was right to abuse her. Webb's treatment of her when he meets her again after all those years is abominable and she just whispers how much she loves him and he can do whatever he wants with her?  Oh dear, oh dear...The ending was a surprise, I have to admit, and Webb's behaviour changed toward the end, but Roanna was still ""slap"" material!",Diana M. Hockley

You really see her character change throughout the book.  There were a lot of emotionally painful moments for her, especially at the beginning and it moved me too.  Wonderful chemistry with the main characters and I liked that many of the acts were written from both of the characters' points of views, allowing the reader to see what each character is thinking/feeling, while realizing exactly how the other character is misinterpreting those same actions/glimpses of emotions.

She then lived with an evil cousin Jessie who bullied and tormented her constantly for 10 years.  Jessie was killed and the relatives at first believed Roanna did it, then later believed Webb did it so he left town for 10 years.  He made erroneous assumptions about Roanna and acted like he hated her as he left.  He was the only one who cared for her and raised her from age 7, and she felt abandoned.  Other relatives came to live in the house with Roanna and treated her badly for the next 10 years.  I have four problems with this book.First, Roanna was too much of a victim and everyone else contributed to it.  The grandmother should have done more to protect and help Roanna, especially when Roanna was initially accused of the murder by the relatives.  I did not enjoy having the majority of the story  dealing with the sadness, grief and helplessness of this victim.My second complaint is that Roanna and Webb both lusted for and loved each other but they stayed away from each other due to making wrong assumptions.  He felt like he forced sex on her, and said it wouldn't happen again.  She thought he didn't like sex with her and didn't want her anymore so she said she understood and that she would leave him alone.  He said you don't understand anything, but he didn't clarify.  She thought he didn't want her.  I don't know why he continued to stay away from her.  This went on for most of the book.  She was honest in her communication, but he was not.  Finally when they did get together he said ""I've tried to stay away from you.""  She said ""Why.""  He said ""God knows.""  Later he said ""I thought I was being noble by not taking advantage of you.""  I never did understand his reasons.  He should not have stayed away from her like that and should have been more direct in his communication with her.Third, the author spent too much time inside Roanna's head, thinking and worrying about things.  Many of these worries were based on erroneous assumptions or could have been solved.  Some of this bored me.Fourth, I was confused about cousins who shared the same grandmother being able to marry and produce offspring with genetic safety.  This sounded like they were too closedly related to me, but I'm not familiar enough with genetics to know.Sexual language: moderate.  Number of sex scenes: nine.  Setting:  1990s Alabama.

Shades of Twilight is quite a book.The story centers around an old-money, prestigious Southern family, the Davenports, and their poorer relations, the Tallants. The Davenport Matriarch is Lucinda. She had two children, a son and a daughter. The daughter had an illegitamate daughter, Jessie, and the son and daughter-in-law had a daughter, Roanna. Then there's also Webb Tallant, Lucinda's grand-nephew who lives at the Davenport estate with his mother since his father died. When Lucinda's two children and daughter-law are killed in a car accident, her two grand-daughters, Jessie and Roanna, come to live at the estate. Webb was raised and groomed to be the heir to the Davenport legacy. It was also expected that Webb would marry Jessie (they were only distantly blood-related). Jessie was the one always getting attention. She was pretty, esteemed, graceful, and all that. Roanna was the misfit, always in Jessie's shadow and getting in trouble, but Webb always stuck up for Roanna, though she was 7 years younger than him. They had a special bond.Anyway, Jessie and Webb marry in their early-twenties, but the marriage quickly goes sour. Then Jessie is murdered and though it can't be proved, Webb is thought by many to have done it. He leaves town and doesn't return for ten years, when Roanna goes to him and asks him to return because Lucinda is dying.The bulk of the story then takes place during that period as a relationship develops between Roanna and Webb, and things begin to happen that endanger Webb, and later Roanna.This book was just...enthralling...in a way. I just could not put it down. It's such a twisted, dark tale in a lot of ways. LH doesn't mince words in this book. There's nothing flowery about it. The language at times is coarse, but fitting. And she crosses the line on taboo's blatantly. But it doesn't take away from the story. It makes it all the more powerful.There's a definite suspense tale to the story, but it's not the biggest part of it. A lot of this story is about the characters. The book just completely draws you in on an emotional level. It pulls at you in a way that so many books don't. The characters are so vibrant and you really feel for them. And the relationship between Webb and Roanna is compelling.There are a bunch of things about the book that would put some readers off. It is a dark tale. But man it was good.Rating: 5 / 5","JJN-1313 ""JJN-1313"""

(I haven't read any of her J.D.Robb works, but I'll get to it sooner or later.)I hate to sound cliched, but I read romance novels for the plots and not the smut. Since this will be my first romance novel review, I'll explain myself a little here. They have an adult fairy tale feel for me: you can trust them to have a decent, happy ending. ""Shades of Twilight"" hit the limits of what I find acceptable amounts of smut. The book even starts with a sex scene! How scandalous! The smut bordered from being simply too steamy to over the top and crude. If they weren't having sex then the characters were thinking about it.The storyline was relatively different enough to keep me interested even when the smut made me want to go away. One issue readers may have is how seemingly incestuous the relationships in the book are. Howard pushes the lines on what is and isn't socially acceptable, but writes it in a way to keep the reader hooked and willing to explore the possibilities.I haven't read any of Howard's other works, but her ability to keep me engaged and emotionally vested in the character's well-being, despite my discomfort, has me contemplating what else to read by her.

3219240,0671019716,5,"A riveting, suspenseful and poignant story",A3APPKALUGB2GT,"[6, 8]","Having never read any of Linda Howard's books, I was glad that I chose this one to start off with for this had me riveted from page one.At the tender age of seven, Roanna Davenport lost her parents in a tragic car accident. From then on, she would struggle to gain the love and acceptance that she so craved from her grandmother and her other relatives. Plain and gauche, she would bear the constant comparison between her and the so-called crown princess of the Davenport empire, her cousin Jessie. As a child who couldn't seem to do anything right, she retreated to the stables where, in the company of her beloved horses, she never felt inadequate. For a decade, she endured the seemingly tolerant treatment from her grandmother and constant criticism from Jessie, with only the friendship of her distant cousin Webb, whom she has fallen in love with, to get her by. Even after Webb marries Jessie, Roanna kept her hurt inside herself, but when Jessie is found murdered and Webb was initially accused of her death, only to be let free due to lack of evidence, Roanna's world would come crumbling down when he decides to leave town. And having had enough of trying to win the love of everyone around her, she would withdraw from her family, using indifference as self-protection from further rejection.Ten years later, at her dying grandmother's plea, Roanna tracks down Webb in Arizona. In her case, seeing him again reopens old wounds and reawakens old passion; for him, he is shocked to the core to see the transformation in her not only physically, but in her character as well. Gone is the girl who once looked up to him like he was her knight in shining armor; gone is the girl whose emotions he once read so easily. Now standing in front of him is a sophisticated woman with unsmiling eyes.SHADES OF TWILIGHT is a saga about a family struggling to come to terms with betrayal and greed. But while the author creates a story stemming from problems involving the Davenport family, the highlight of the story is, of course, on Roanna and Webb. Roanna had me drawn from the start. Her insecurities, hunger for the love of her family, and general lack of self-worth tugged at my heart. I know that some people would probably feel that she is too needy or weak. Personally, I thought that the author has developed her character so well that I felt nothing but empathy for her, and seeing her transformation from an awkward teenager into a woman capable of handling a business empire earned my admiration. As for Webb, well he is definitely worthy of Roanna's undying love, because while everyone else treated her with mere tolerance when she was younger, Webb was there to support and encourage her.

Howard continues to do what she does best - deliver intense, steamy modern romances with a hint of mystery to keep the plot moving along.  The core romance is strong, and as usual, the hero is an appealing combination of  tender caring and strong masculinity.  My biggest problem with this book was that the heroine was just too passive - not the spunky, independent modern woman you'd expect in a Linda Howard novel.  I also wasn't crazy about the cliche Southern family all living together under one big roof with distant cousins pairing up.  That doesn't really work in a contemporary novel, but Howard comes close to pulling it off.  Despite my complaints, I did enjoy the book, and you will too if you have enjoyed other Linda Howard novels.  However, if you aren't familiar with Howard's work, better to start with one of her better novels.  &quot;After the Night&quot;, &quot;Dream Man&quot; or any of the MacKenzie saga would be great choices.","mirope ""mirope"""

I've read it well over a dozen of times, yet every single time certain scenes have me crying from the emotional tugs (and believe me, that is a feat - I am not normally a crier). Howard shines in this touching tale of love reunited, betrayal, murder and intrigue.The main characters in Shades of Twilight are very well fleshed out, and by the novel's end, I felt like I'd really gotten to know this family. Even the ""bad guy"" is extremely well fleshed, so that you know his reasoning and motivations behind his actions, not just his depravities. Roanna Davenport is, in particular, a character I could identify with, due to her need to be needed and her strong capability to love and forgive. I love how Howard takes enough time with the first sections of the book to give us the past so that when we come to the ""present day"" you can really tell the differences in the characters, especially Roanna. When her grandmother points some of the most dramatic changes the early events caused, that's when the tears start flowing.Webb, as well, as a strong male character, with his own ability to forgive those who have hurt him, despite his having a stubborn streak. After getting to know him, there is no doubt that anyone privilege to be in his circle of family and friends will not regret it and will always have someone there for them.Howard paces the book well, with both past and present given just the right amount of attention. The only complaint I can foresee some reader's having is that Howard had no qualms of adding an incestuous (and rather perverse) relationship to the mix, which precipitated a great deal of the events.  If you stop reading the novel just because of that, though, you are missing out on a great story.  It's a prologue to where things end up, not the bulk of the story.My copy is well worn, as I have yet to get tired of rereading it.

This is my second Linda Howard book, and it will most definately NOT be my last.  This is a story about Roanna and Webb. They are distant second cousins. 7 year old Roanna is left orphaned when her parents die in a car accident. She comes to live with her grandmother at Davencourt, her families rich estate. She does not feel welcome by her family, they treat her as if she is not wanted, but only Webb is there to protect her and make her feel safe.Roanna grows up developing a huge crush on Webb and practically worships him. She tries out her burgeoning feelings for him in a kiss that sets of a cataclysim of events. Webb and his wife Jessie,Roanna's other cousin, have a fight and threaten each other with divorce.  That very night,Jessie ends up dead.Everyone in the family blames Webb, even though the police have no evidence of the fact. He feels no support from anyone and he takes off to start a new life. Spirited Roanna having lost Webb, the only person who ever made her feel worthy, is at a loss. She hides inside her self. Ceasing to care about anyone or anything.  Ten years pass, and Roanna grows older, gone is the hoydenish teenager,and in her place is a quiet and sophisticated young woman. At her grandmothers request, Roanna goes off to find Webb. Her grandmother wants to make peace with him before she dies.Webb is surprised when he first sees Roanna all grown up. Gone was the spirited girl with adoring eyes, in her place was a woman with no outward signs of emotion. He feels strong emotions for her, and is upset with the way she is all closed up to him. All withdrawn from everything. Unable to resist her anymore, he takes Roanna and spends a night with her filled with love and passion.Roanna still loves Webb, but does not believe that he could actually love her back. She believes that he will go back to Davencourt for the estate and money, but never for her.Webb is drawn to Roanna and desperately wants to see her the way she was. Laughing and smiling again. He returns because of her. Unfortunately, someone wants him dead.  They make attempts at his and Roannas life. Webb has to make Roanna see that he loves her for her and at the same time find out who is threatening thier lives.I loved this book. I especially loved the romance and love between Roanna and Webb.

I feel that if you took all the conversations in this book & put them together it would've only taken up about 15 pages or so.  If that.

Ro has a massive crush on fellow cousin Webb (his grandma and Ro and Jessie's grandma are sisters), who has always stood up for her. Of course, when they grow up, it is Jessie that Webb woos and marries, much to Ro's heartbreak.But a kiss suddenly turns passionate and results in turmoil for all members of the family. After Jessie discovers Webb and Ro in each others arms, she throws a fit (despite being in a torrid affair with her birth father). They fight and Webb walks out and soon Jessie is found bludgeoned, and all the family except Ro think Webb is guilty. After being cleared, Webb moves to Arizona and becomes a hardened and weary man.  He returns years later at Lucinda's request. She sends Ro for him, and he agrees as long as she provides what everyone assumes he got when she was a teen.

First there is Southern family drama. I am from the South and there is nothing that gives me larger charge than reading about the life, loves and scandal of a family set in the South.The book is set in two pieces. The first half is all set up. We meet the principle players all at very young, impressionable ages and get a feel for all the intertwined relationships. And then, abruptly, a chain of events that end in a shocking murder. The second half of the book takes place years later and deals with the fallout.What makes this book so good are the gamut emotions that Howard sends her characters through. She rings out every moment of love, angst, betrayal and deceit for maximum effect. And it isn't overwrought or melodramatic at all.

And this is very disappointing for me since this book includes stories from some of my favourite authors, particularly Davidson, Warren and McCarthy.  If you just want a quick taste of each, I guess this is worth your effort, but if you want more than that, don't bother.Ms Kauffman closes out her Morgan Brothers series with Burke's story.  Preparing to set out on his maiden voyage as captain of his own pleasure cruise business, his partner drops the bomb on him that he's taken a job Down Under.  He placates Burke by assuring him that his granddaughter is just as good a cook as he is.  When he meets Kam, she sure looks good, but she's also seasick.  You can imagine how he cures her of it.  Really not much to this one at all.  The most satisfying part was the epilogue which wrapped up the series.Ms Warren has perky weather girl Marisa and her survivalist cameraman Rob stranded in a blizzard.  Rob thinks she's a superficial twinkie but is attracted to her anyway, much to his disgust.  Marisa thinks he's surly and superior.  Their forced time together brings them to the conclusion that neither is what the other seemed.  One of the better of the bunch, but do they still have perky weather girls?  I thought these days you had to be a meterologist to do TV weather!Erin McCarthy's story felt a lot like a Lori Foster short - you decide if that's good or bad!  It was a cute story of cartoonist Josh who has finally decided to tell his best friend Cassidy that he wants to be more than friends.  He does it through his cartoon strip, but she misunderstands what it means.  This one was cute and enjoyable.MaryJanice disappointed me (and she is one of my VERY fave authors!).  Her story was so reminiscent of an earlier short story for another Xmas anthology, Santa Claws from the Naughty or Nice collection from a few years back.  Except in this story, the sidewalk Santa is cop Corrine undercover to catch a purse snatcher and her love interest is wealthy Brit business man Grant instead of a wealthy Scottish werewolf.  While I always love MJD's stories and this one had it's wonderfully quirky and crazy moments, I felt like I had read it before.  But if you haven't read Santa Claws, you just may love it.Ms Monroe's story of a virgin lingerie model (!) and a Texas rancher was sweet but just seemed so unrealistic to me.  But I must say Jake was a hunk and a half - very sexy!I think Susanna Carr's story was my favourite and that surprised me as I'd never read her before.  A group of old friends reunite in their small hometown for the holidays and get trapped together during a snowstorm.  A power outtage, a mistaken bedroom, an incredible sexual encounter and the realization in the morning light that Karen did not enter the bedroom she thought!  Can Tyler convince her that it was the right one afterall?

3774724,0765350602,4,"Well done, but flawed",A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,"[5, 6]","The sad fact is that there is pretty much nothing new and original in the world today. All we have is rehash and repackaging of stuff we've seen elsewhere before.Then again, I've mentioned that before in several different reviews I've written.But, fact is, it's all dependant on how things are packaged, how the particular author meshes all these ideas into a single storyline.Not even the ideas I've had for various books or stories are original. They're all just variants of something we've seen before. Does it mean that they wouldn't be well accepted? I certainly hope that's not the case, but I do realize that there will always be someone who'll point at a particular piece of work and say `I've seen that before' or `I've read that story elsewhere'.Again, it's all in the execution.Look also at just how much technology has changed over the past twenty years. I've heard a commercial on the radio that stated `for $1000 name five different ways of communicating'. Twenty years ago, it would be difficult. Today, you could easily name far more than five ways.I think that the biggest impact to technology have been the Internet and personal communication devices (cellular phones to be exact). These two technological leaps for our species have opened up so many new avenues for us.Before, you needed to get information; you typically had to go to the library, or even a school or university. Today, all it really takes is a click of the mouse and a few key strokes and viola, you've got what you're looking for.And we're able to keep in touch far easier than ever. Who needs old fashioned letters when you can text message or type an email? Or hell, do the really old fashioned thing and pick up a phone and make a call? You can even do video calls over the net today, and have been able to do so for several years.What does this technology hold for us in the future? Just look at the Cyberpunk Genre. Jacking your mind into a computer probably isn't all that far off the way technology keeps advancing.But, as with everything, there is a downside. With machines getting smarter by the day, programs becoming more and more complicated and advanced, how long is it going to be before true AI, or artificial intelligence becomes a reality?And when that happens, will it go and pull a Skynet and declare war against it's creators, finding us nothing more than vermin to be exterminated, or will it end up turning its vast intellect to the betterment of mankind?That's all for the realm of speculation at this time.The novel Spyware by R.J. Pineiro deals with several of these topics.I have to admit, I wasn't too impressed with the names he chose for several of his characters, like Mac Savage and Donald Bane. Too clich&eacute;. Also, come on, we've seen former Navy SEAL's dozens upon dozens of times.However, what we've not seen dozens of times is that these characters are flawed. Some even have crippling flaws, dealing with the repercussions of their actions years after the fact.Mr. Pineiro weaves a very complex story, one which involves blood diamonds, a multi-national spanning corporation, cyberpunk style computer interfacing, and a rogue AI, who is being led by individuals with sinister goals in mind.I honestly wish that the whole internet browsing that was depicted in this novel existed today, but I think it is still many years off. I do have to say though that I get the feeling that the author played the Shadowrun or Cyberpunk Role playing games though, or that he read a great deal of William Gibson.The novel also weaves pretty much three different story arcs which all eventually come together at the end of the novel in a pretty action packed finale.The novel was pretty hefty, weighing in at 564 pages, so it's a nice long read.It could have been better, and it felt strange reading the cyberpunk aspect of it, when it's supposed to be set in modern times.Despite the fact that the characters were clich&eacute;, and that I felt that many ways I was reading something right out of the Terminator, I did like it. I liked how the main character Mac Savage was haunted by his actions, and what he ended up doing in order to set things right.I can't give it a perfect rating, but It's still worth reading.3.5 out of 5.","Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen"""

I was born in 1965 and was stressed in the seventies growing up knowing our planet could be blown up several times over. These twenty-one tales, from the late forties to the mid eighties, cover what might have been if buttons were pushed. Reading it in the twenty-first century make it all the more intriguing as these concerns are now swapped for others. With any collection, there are going to be some duds and this is no exception but where the criticism may more accurately lie (and it is a little one) is in the repetition of type of tale. As we are dealing with a post nuclear world as the central theme, several plots have us returning to agrarian times (reinforcing the belief that if such a conflict had taken place then the next one would be fought with spears).Some vary from this theme like Salvador which introduces a mercenary-like US military, The Store of the Worlds that is more like a Twilight Zone episode, and The Four Horseman that imagines an American Idol-like show that has global implications. I enjoyed The Lot with the creepy father who has his own ideas of family survival, Days at the Beach which reminded me of Stephen King who wrote a beach-based end of the world tale in one of his collections, and Tomorrow's Children would make a great movie.

Some are clearly post-apocalyptic, while others are less firmly of that genre. Much less thought-provoking that I had hoped; in great part due to Miller's ramblings ahead of each piece. Instead of simply introducing the story, Miller uses the opportunity to preach his convictions about the sordidness of war and politics and the human condition. The comments and characterizations grow so venomous that it makes the cast of St. Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman seem saintly.On the other hand, the stories themselves are a eclectic in the extreme and I mean that as a positive. Ranging from the well known ('A Boy and His Dog') to poorly unknown, the collection addresses life in the post-apocalyptic world, though, in a few cases, the term is expanded to include mental states as well as the notional rising mushroom cloud scenarios. In one case, there is not even the hint of a nuclear conflict; here, the editors - because it suited their objectives - have armageddon defined as a world where racial downsizing is underway. While I'll grant that the results are every bit as terrifying - maybe more so - I felt it was another 'brick in the wall' of Miller's anti-mankinf agenda.Some stories are thought-provoking; some are terrifying.

There are some excellent examples of the gripping stories that kept me up as a kid here, anyone who remembers that time will appreciate this book as both fiction and history.For those who love post apocalyptic fiction I would also point you to two of the best books written in this genre, also by the co-editor of this anthology, Walter Miller:A Canticle for LeibowitzandSaint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman.

Col may be illiterate, a man who's lived by his wits since the age of nine, but he's a man who can see beauty and goodness.  Accustomed to the freedom and isolation of a mountain man's life, he longs to return to the wilderness until he meets Brianna who makes him yearn for a permanent place, for the first time in his life.  Brianna  is immersed in the mindset of the time as to a woman's place.  She believes herself the cause of the abuse she suffers at her husband's hands, and sees the loss of her sister and friends as some kind of punishment.  Even when she admits her love for Col, she refuses to act on it because she's married and she won't break that final vow.  Barrett is a typical wife-abuser. A coward and a bully, he sees it as his right to ""punish"" the woman he's suppose to protect.The minor characters are also well-portrayed, showing the different classes and people from various walks of life...an upper class French mercantile owner, a widow with a man-hungry daughter, a man and his younger brother, the lecherous wagonmaster, a French trapper.  Each and everyone is detailed enough to make them interesting and involve the reader in their part in the story, no matter how brief.The hardships of the pioneers is related in detail, and one can almost feel the heat, the dust and grime, and the aching muscles from walking all day besides a team of oxen pulling a conestoga.  The beauty of the Great Plains is here, too, as well as itscruelty, a land so different from the ones these people have left behind as they travel toward a new life.  Some didn't make it.  Their graves lay in Ash Hollow and in unmarked spots along the trail.  Others, Like Col and Brianna had their hopes realized, but only after much suffering.If I'd had time , I would've read this in one sitting.  As it was, I had to space it out over three days!  Having ridden the Oregon Trail through Nebraska,  lived on the banks of the North Platte, seen Windlass Hill, the names carved into the Register of the Desert,  and the graves at Ash Hollow, I probably enjoyed it more than someone who hasn't actually viewed the landmarks.

The sex scenes of the book are hot if you enjoy spanking and what I consider to be scenes only containing a physical attraction.I enjoy this type of scenes but prefer works from authors like Cherise Sinclair being very much about domination but also about feelings.The scene were Sinead gets off by using a bidet was just not my taste at all. I can't stop thinking about members of my family using a bidet and i have to admit it's a fantasy I don't enjoy.

However, my opinion vastly differs from hers.  I enjoyed the story very much.  You have two strong minded and willed lead characters: Sinead O'Malley and Jack Quinn who weren't looking to settle down forced together and discover that they're made for each other.  Romance comes in many forms; not everyone needs hearts and flowers.  The chemistry and the surprise of finally meeting someone who can dance with you as you fulfill your thirsty for BDSM is intoxicatingly delicious. The feelings on display in this novel are more about inner struggles Sinead and Jack must face to make room for their hearts desire.  Sinead is a proud woman who works so her family can make ends meet while Jack is wealthy and eager to share to his riches.  How do you present your husband to your family when your families have been feuding for generations? How do you accept being challenged when all before you have deferred to you? How do you maintain your modern independence when entering a traditional union in a traditional land? The banter between the two is foreplay.  The tug for power stimulates both the dominant and submissive and makes the submission sweeter for them both. The whole bidet thing isn't my personal cup of tea and it's no where on my fantasy radar; but, I do not begrudge Sinead her tastes.  After all it isn't that big a leap from using a showerhead for sexual pleasure. I have read many BDSM books and many romance novels; Ms. Cartwright definitely wrote a book that satisfied my cravings for both genres.

Determination to right many wrongs drives him back to the people and land that once laid witness to the very things that drove him away. For years he has hidden from what happened, but now he seeks a little dram of peace for his soul and a place he can claim for himself and his daughter Kathryn.But the town is far from over the scars cast upon it while he lived there as a boy. Still reemerging from the terrible waist of the infamous Great Famine, Ballycashel itself is in need of a healing as well. When their old master passes and this new one takes the reins, many are looking upon Burke with a knowing eye. Siobhan Desmond knows not why the brooding man attracts her so, but she feels in her heart he is a good person, despite her experiences with the old master. Like all residents of the town, her heart is still healing and she and Burke begin a tenuous dance as old as time--one of love and all the promise it holds in its grasp, if only they would seize it. Can Burke find a way back to the land that was always waiting to welcome him and let go of painful secrets? Danger is only a stones throw away and he and Siobhan will have to find a way to fight without sacrificing their hearts.Many heartfelt sighs were wrenched from me as Burke and Siobhan's story unfurled.

Nothing irritates me more than that.  This was not like that, this is so good.

Tom, knowing that  Cedar and her mother Flora are alone now with nobody else in their lives, offers to help them with things such as plowing and fixing the roof.  His motive is to see Cedar.  I won't say anymore about that.Another nice touch to the story is the relationship with her mother and another rancher.

She makes a living by visiting the relatives of missing people and extorting money from them in exchange for invented facts about their missing relatives.  When a local woman disappears, she sees an opportunity to target the anxious husband.  However when she goes to visit him, he doesn't react in the way that she expected - because, she belatedly realises, he is not as innocent as she has assumed.The story has plenty of twists along the way and it moves at a good pace.  So where's the problem?  Firstly, there's no one too root for.  Every character who makes an appearance is more unpleasant and stupid than the previous one.  Secondly, whenever problems arise, they get resolved at a rapid pace, so the suspense never really builds up.  And finally, the ""neat"" ending is simply far too silly.  The best thing about this book?  It's mercifully short.",Julia Flyte

Never Saw it Coming is a fleshed out version of a novella originally published in the UK in 2011 as Clouded Vision.Keisha Ceylon is a psychic. Or so she says. What she really does is comb the news for missing persons reports. And then she helpfully offers her psychic services to the distraught families....for a fee of course.Hot on the heels of a successful scam, she hears about Ellie Garfield's disappearance. Perfect. But perhaps her predictions are a little too close to the truth this time. Ellie's husband thinks so. And he doesn't like loose ends.Never Saw it Coming does read like a short story with lots of rapid twists and turns. Barclay is a master manipulator and takes the narrative in oft changing directions. And finishes up with an ending I didn't predict. Those looking for great character development and intricate plotting won't find it with this offering. But if you're looking for a fast paced read to keep you turning pages for an evening, this is definitely for you.

My expectations may have been a little too high; I was just a bit disappointed.Chris Pinckley does a pretty good job of presenting the basic ""think positive and the universe responds"" message. I think he would agree that his material isn't that original, but he does provide the material from his own unique point of view.People who really like his message will really like the book. I think it is fair to say that there is not a whole lot of depth here, though. That is, the narration centers around a series of incidents where he was a bodybuilder with a bad attitude and bad things happened. Then, he changed his attitude and good things started to happen.If I picked one thing I didn't like, it would be the pseudo-scientific jargon that he inserts to try to sound smart -- it has the opposite effect.If I picked one thing I really liked -- it would be the straightforward presentation; he is clear as a bell.If you are already sold on ""think positive"" then you will enjoy this book.",Aaron U.

5293257,1439200041,4,Good Title,A1EL0WD73VJUD,"[10, 14]","I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 1 because the title is honest. This is ""101"" material, barebones with some left out for a ""tension"" effect. My take is that the author is a man of few words and does not buy into some of the more fluffy steps that other books go into, like really needing to soak in the FEELING of what you want. Just saying out loud what you want is sufficient. Then let it go. So if you're used to the Hicks (Abraham) teachings, this might feel like an icy out-house seat in the dead of winter at midnight when you're used to the soothing heated version indoors. As I write this review I keep thumbing through the book which is at least 3/4"" thick, to double and triple check the length of the average chapter, which is about 3 pages, sometimes 5, trying to figure out how you get such a thick book from such short chapters. Well I guess there are just alot of them. In case you're ever tempted to shell out the big bucks for the sedona method course, this book has it on pages 127-9, but this time invented by the author. I wouldn't even blink at that though because this and most self help books now are just rewrites of rewrites of rewrites. I think the fresher ideas tapered off around 1974 or so.So this was a reviews-based purchase for me. I wasn't paying attention to the title. Sometimes the gullable me takes over and forgets all about self help book review etiquette. ""If you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all"". So now I'll review the reviews. I'm thinking that when people read self help books, they feel as though the review should be a dress rehearsal for what they learned in the book. And if you don't give a standing ovation regardless, then you didn't absorb the books lessons very well. So in essence, I wonder if reviewers of these sorts of books feel like THEY are onreview. This will be my last ""law of attraction"" purchase.The parts of the reviews that most convinced me to buy the book were that the author had a hard life. Now i'm wondering: ""Compared to what??""",J.

And, coming from a place of struggle - Pinkley recounts several of the personal challenges he faced - this book just rings true. You get the feeling Pinkley has learned from experience.Pinkley sets himself the non-negligible task of explaining how to ""Create Your Own Reality"". First of all, argues Chris, you're already creating your reality - you might simply not be aware of it yet. The idea then is that, by repetitively thinking certain thoughts over and over, you ""manifest"" or draw to yourself the very scenarios you've imagined. According to Pinkley, awareness is key in learning to manage this process.Pulling all the our assumptions and behaviors out from unconscious reactivity-mode and into our peripheral vision is the beginning of gaining control of what you draw to yourself. Afterwards, Pinkley gets into the specific techniques for manifesting such as visualization, taking action and emotional releasing.Many of these ideas could seem airy-fairy without the proper, grounded explanations and techniques provided by Pinkley.

I'd often question him about his past, and this visibly frustrated him.  To him, my questions showed that I didn't trust him.  And without trust, he'd said, we had nothing.  I had to trust him.  I had to put my faith in him, or we'd never get out of this mess.  If I wasn't standing by him, unquestioning and loyal, then I was exacerbating the situation for him, by undermining him.  This in turn meant he was unable to `solve the issues', and so the problem perpetuated itself.'I don't know the stats as to how many marriages end up in divorce but I'm sure they are extremely high.  But there are still those marriages that probably should have ended in marriage and didn't.  I feel that most of these ""sick"" marriages are due to the wife and I'm sure sometimes the husband feeling that some, if not all problems have been caused by them.  If I had only done this.  If I had only been a more loving person.  If I had only been more understanding.  The ifs go on and on.Even if divorce seems to be the only solution, many still have problems accepting the inevitable.  They still feel they must take the full blame.`I'd been stripped bare.  There was nothing left.  I was functioning for the sake of my children, yet I was barely there as a person in my own right.  I was losing control, and I saw no way of regaining my life.  I wasn't worthy of my children.  They deserved better.  I had brought this all on myself.  I was being a victim.  I lived to be a victim.  I could never be a strong and beautiful person, because I was weak and pathetic.  I'd allowed this to happen to me because of the type of person I was.  I was looking for misery.  I wanted misery.  I must be craving it, and now the universe had delivered it.  Misery.  It was no more than I deserved.'May of us go through bad marriages.  I've been through a couple myself and as I read Web of Lies I found myself relating to Sarah's life, feelings and self-disgust.  If those of us who have been there will be honest with ourselves we can honestly say ""been there, done that.""  We find reasons to keep us in a ""sick"" marriage...kids, money, even not wanting to be accused of being a failure.  But in the end, we are very possibly become a victim of a form of mind control.In Web of Lies, Author Sarah Tate puts her own life out for public view.  Throughout the book she expresses her self-loath and sees herself as a weak, pathetic person who deserved everything she went through.  I personally see her as an extremely strong person.  I can't say how much I've enjoyed reading Web of Lies, not as one would enjoy a novel but as one would find while reading a book that seemed to really hit home for them in so many ways.",Martha A.

5369758,1446779882,5,Some webs are too tangled,A3H8GNI7FAMGWE,"[2, 2]","Web of Lies: Author Sarah TateThere are many definitions of blindness. One where the person cannot visually see and the other where we sometimes are blinded by the truth in order to compensate for something missing in our lives when our happiness hinges on what we think we believe. People are not always what they appear to be and innocent women and men are often drawn into the webs of deceit, lies and intrigue when enveloped by someone that presents themselves as upstanding, well to do and respectful. But, hidden beneath this false veneer or faade is a person that no one really wants to get to know but one whose personality is so destructive and whose victims learn to late as you will learn in Web of Lies a true and heartfelt story told by author Sarah Tate who lived it. Narcissistic personality disorder is often hard to detect if you are mesmerized and blinded by the person's kindness, false caring and extreme attention. A person with this type of disorder needs to feel in control, powerful and definitely preoccupied with his/her own self-importance and worth. These people need others to almost bow down to them and humble themselves in order to be in their presence. But, it takes cunning and clever person to snare their victim into their Web and create a feeling of comfort and confidence before the truth comes out. Bill Tate met Sarah during an interview she was having for a new job in Switzerland. Interrupting the conversation he did not seem concerned with the outcome of her interview only that he gained her total attention. Sarah, at the onset and time thought him kind, considerate and just trying to show her around her new surroundings. Little did she know what he was really up to and some of the warning signs that she immediately saw she did not heed. Bill wined and dined her although all she wanted was his friendship and no more, but he had a whole other agenda in mind. Throughout the start of their relationship Bill wined and dined Sarah and made her feel like a princess sitting on her own special throne. But, that was the part his luring her into his den of deceit and hate. So, why would she marry him and why did she fall prey?March 2001 Bill decided to propose and take Sarah away on a romantic tryst to seal the deal. He even managed to convince her of the venue for the wedding. Even though it appeared she had the ability to decide and make choices she really did not. However, this is when the warning signs should have appeared and the red flags but when you think you really care for someone and are overwhelmed by their attention you are often blindsided as she was and so was everyone else. When Bill told her of his first failed marriage and the death/suicide of his second wife Sophia, that alone should have set off alarms but he was so convincing all she felt was sadness and compassion for what he claimed he went through. Even staying with Sophia's close friends in order to clear out her things and bring what he wanted home, should have alerted Sarah to his true personality but it did not. A marriage of business convenience gone sour and a woman who might have wanted more but he claimed he did not. Camouflaged within this man who was much older than Sarah was someone else. The story has just begun and there is much more tell as I review Web Of Lies by Sarah Tate.Then the money he had began to disappear, his claim that Sophia stole from him and took loans out seemed to be able to fool everyone. The intricate web of deceit really dug deep into Sarah's heart, naivety and mind as Bill began to unravel and his true colors appeared but each time Sarah seemed resigned to believe him and not see past what he was really doing. Financial constraints, blaming them on Sophia and claiming he was superior to his bosses and they did not appreciate him. At times he claimed he took jobs that were beneath him in order to bring money into their home but Sarah lost more than just her pension money she lost her life as she would know it. Blaming Bill for Sophia's death her parents would not want anything to do with him. Can you blame them? Using Sarah as his cover he even transferred funds, their home and more into her name filing for bankruptcy in order to not payback loans and other money and got away with it.  Marriage seems right at the time but was it when things finally came to light. A red flag at their wedding should have warned her that his own family did not want to be around him. A startling dream on her honeymoon was just a prelude for what we are now learning about him.As they started their own company she thought things would go right but his business practices were questioned and he once again lied and claimed it was not his doing or fault. One lawyer that took his side and he was able to forge ahead for a while and many jobs and contracts fell through and still Sarah did not really see the light. Moving around and going from job to job and now they would have to move again as Bill could not seem to get along with anyone that was in a higher position than him and moving from Switzerland might be her salvation except now she was pregnant again. She needed help and was handling everything on her own but her new friends came to her aide. But, if she were not to have any stress how would she handle another court order demanding money and payment from another bank? Except this was for her wedding.Creating websites for people and charging them was Bill's latest money making idea. Holding court at events in order to draw attention to him and shine the spotlight on him his norm. Instead of raising the fog that surrounded her and clear her blurred vision she ignored it and pushed her thoughts aside.A startling revelation that stared her right in the face and now Sarah would regain her life. Just how she deals with the debts, the lies, the rest of his deceit and how she learns the truth about Sophia's death, her relationship with Bill and more you need to learn for yourself. In the prologue you hear Sophia's words, her final moments, seconds and her pain. As the author leads you on this tragic journey you learn much about this mentally ill man who preys on women, lies, manipulates and actually believes his own false truths in order to obliterate his sins. Dr. David Holmes adds a very insightful and informative Comment Section at the end of the book explaining Narcissist Personality Disorder and its manifestations and how it can be recognized and treated. Sarah you have finally found yourself and who you really are so never look back. You have realized that you have a solid voice that needs to be heard and sharing your story with the world you will not only let go of some of your anger and fear but help other women too.I am really honored to have been asked to read and review this book and hopefully someday the world will not have to deal with any more Bills.",Samfreene

It's easy to, watching the old movies on TV, or new movies, all in English with US actors. And of course all the wonderful books we grew up with were in English. I hope that is considered a compliment as to his power and success, as he was just as enormously popular in France, and is the founding father of science fiction with perhaps with H.G. Wells. Verne's stories, written for all ages, caught the enterprising spirit of the 19th century and its uncritical fascination about scientific progress and inventions.

The writer nails the chemistry between the protagonists spot on. I love how the test of their bond for each other came from Caitlin's mother and not from the couple themselves. It's true... sometimes falling in love is easy and sometimes chemistry and compatibility does lend to a smooth ride, and sometimes the biggest trials of relationships come from meddling in-laws.

I wish that I had taken the time to read some of the reviews before I tackled this puppy. I don't want to start out on a sour note, so I'll begin with the things that I liked:1. It was free.Okay, I feel better now that I've listed the positives. Moving on...**SPOILERS AHEAD**...though, I can't really see them as spoilers since the book had no real..umm..er...well..anything.The story starts off with the hero, Rilo/Chris, leaving his planet via a wish fulfilling travel agent with slimy hands, to find and bond with a life mate. The only things he required of his life mate were that she want children and be faithful. Slimy Hands takes this information and sends Rilo/Chris to Earth to meet Caitlyn. Caitlyn has no idea these aliens even exist. They meet. Within 10 minutes of talking, he doses her with what I can only describe as erection essence, and they both start climbing the walls needing to O. What does this woman, who hasn't been with anyone since her husband died, decide to do with this unusual desire that makes no sense to her? Drive away whit him in her van to go bump uglies on the side of the road. If you think that I'm exaggerating, read the book.At this point I'm thinking that this book is weird, but it has to get better. It has to? Really? Oh nay nay! Now that they have hooked up, they are bonded for life. I understand that a person can never really know how they would react in a situation until they are actually in it, but I'd like to think that I would have had a different reaction than Caitlyn when fitting together all the pieces of the Rilo/Chris puzzle. I don't really think that I would accept my credit cards, social security card, pay check, license, etc changing information inside of my wallet while I wasn't looking. (Slimy Hands changed all of her information to have Rilo/Chris' last name. Fun stuff!)  I can't swear to it, but I think I might have a problem discovering that I just shtooped E.T. and we're stuck together until one of us dies. Caitlyn is a better man than me because aside from blinking a few times and having to double check to verify the Internet agreed with these changes, she was perfectly fine.I considered that maybe she was as accepting as she was because of the bond dinky juice, but her friend was just as accepting when she found out. ""He's an alien, who bonded you to him for life, and now you're married according to your paycheck stub? Wow, does he have a brother?"" Or, you know, something like that.I don't like to criticize too much when an author creates a new world because it is that person's vision. It doesn't have to make sense to me. I like for alien worlds to be different, but I don't like for the fictional planet's race to give me the creeps. I'm sorry, but it's creepy to me that the hero had a medical problem during an argument with the heroine because she didn't assure him that she still loved him. She said it that morning, calm down Buddy.Last thing. He's a virgin because there are no women on his planet. I'm not going to get into the pills they take to avoid erections. I don't recommend this book, but if you're looking for other books with virgin heroes, I have two Listmanias dedicated to v-card carrying males.",Book B**ch

In reading romance books a little unrealistic near perfection in a hero isn't something that I avoid.  I'm a bit less tolerant of perfect heroines.  When falling in love at first sight in real life happens, the object of this love seems perfect--or at least perfect for you.  In this story, for this couple, it's literally true.  Not realistic, no, but satisfying nonetheless.  There are a lot of tortured heroes out there so I find this lovely, sensitive, loving one refreshing.  While the heroine was a bit tortured in the beginning, she didn't whine about it for half the story.I've read others of Ms. Norden's books.  Some I like and some I don't.  Not surprising--they aren't all the same.  She seems to be comfortable with more than one sub-genre.  A lot of what she writes seems to be Christian (or is it called Inspirational) romance.  I'm not a fan of that genre, but sometimes enjoy it.  I'm not anti-religion or spirituality, but I usually find those romances boring.  Call it a leftover from a Catholic schools education.  Of course after years of vampire romances I'm no longer enjoying them either, so maybe it's the same idea.The sex is probably more sensual than explicit, but it's pretty hot anyhow.  The HEA was satisfying enough to send me to Amazon's Kindle books to see if I could find more books in this series).  I look forward to reading another when it becomes available.Recommendation?  Get it.  Even if it weren't free, I'd probably have read it.  If it's free, I'll buy it.  I don't always read more than the first few chapters, though.  This one I read straight through.  If you want heart-warming, buy this.  If you want to fall in love with the hero, here's one worthy of that.  If you want erotica, the plausibility of sci fi, or tortured heroes, you're out of luck here.  Well worth the time spent reading it in my opinion",Danielle C. Carter

The story was simple and easy to follow. And at least in the beginning the characters were interesting.Rilo An/Chris West was very different in his innocence. He was sweet and imperfect and very boyish. It was refreshing. Unfortunately, it also got boring. His character didn't seem to grow much, and I soon tired of his ignorance since he took forever to learn anything. Because he was supposed to be this super-smart, otherworldly being, I thought he would catch on faster.That was my other problem: I never got to understand his planet more. Caitlyn never asks about his life on his planet, which I thought was odd since that would be the first thing I would ask an alien-yah know, after I got over the alien part. With Caitlyn, she was just another character. It was nice how she accepted what happened so fast even if it was unrealistic. Otherwise...eh.I am sad to say I skimmed through a few pages (*cough* couple chapters *cough cough*) but I did enjoy parts of it, especially the beginning when I didn't know what to expect.

It was confusing, because I wasn't sure if I was reading a romance, a sci-fi or a cute love story with a sprinkle of eroticism.  The male lead, Chis West, a space traveler who came to earth to find a life mate was a bit insecure, frequently near tears, and although he adored his selected wife Caitlyn, he just didn't have that rugged 'manly' appeal.  Caitlyn barely blinks when she hears the news that she has been bonded until death to an alien as the result of a sort of 'one night stand.'  After  brief disbelief, she accepts the news calmly and life goes on.  Very shortly, she learns that she is carrying a half alien child whch doesn't even give her pause.  The constant descriptions of her pregnancy cravings, both in odd combinations and unfathomable quanity get a bit repetative.All that being said, I did enjoy the book despite the fluff.

I'm giving this book 5 stars, because I had a smile on my face from the time I started it until I finished it!Rilo is a naive young man...ah, alien from the planet Pandoran. He comes to Earth to find his designated life mate. Caitlyn is working in a diner, when she meets the newly arrived Rilo. He blasts her with sex hormones to start the bonding ceremony, and Caitlyn doesn't know what hits her! Sparks fly, emotions roil, and romance abounds.What a cute story! I now have a mad crush on Rilo. I hope there is a sequel. I must know how he handles fatherhood.

It shouldn't be a spoiler as there is no plot to this book. If a 5 years old could write, they would write it better.So, the book started decent enough with this outer space guy really wanting a ""mate who wants children"". He goes to a matchmaking service, when asked what he wanted, he answered :""a mate who wants children."" Okay, you can go to Earth or this other planet, anything you want in this mate? His answer, you guessed it, ""a mate who wants children"".So, he gets to Earth, walks into the dinner where his ""mate"" works and meets her. His mate who have been a widow for the pass 3 years, fell under his ""mate heat"" and had sex with him in her car.Fine and dandy!But, this is where it starts going down hill. He informs her they are married because they had sex which is confirmed by her boss and papers, so she took him home. Welcomes him in her bed again. She accepted the marriage in less than 24 hours with no logical explanation as to why a woman would do that. Two days later, she is happy because she can finally buy a house with her smart, high-paying-job-holding husband. Poor little waitress, her life is finally fulfilled. She can start popping babies in a nice, white picked fence house with her alien husband whom she's been married to for 48 hours. Her plans, not mine. He emitted those pheromones causing her to do have sex with him, which she admits to be out of character for her, that leads to her being married to him and all she did was pick her little house on the prairie. Not two brain cells to rub together between the two of them. Maybe if you threw the author in you might find one and a half.The H had no presence. No life. No being. Just an empty husk waiting to be fertilized by the first sperm who walks through the door. As long as the sperm could afford a little house on the prairie that is. The h didn't fare much better. He was dumb. Asking dumb questions, walking around being stupid and sticking his you know what in her every time he was about to ejaculate.No romance or love was shown. Although she did say she was in love with him, I believe within that same 48 hours window. Whereas all he admits to is to be looking for any female to fertilize his sperm in.Completely retarded.No where in this book, I use the term ""book"" very loosely, did anything happen that would justify to this being published and sold as a book.If you are looking for a book,  don't bother.

In this case, there is mainly one, the bride's mother. Oh, wow, this meddling monster is a stereotype on steroids!There is both comedy and tragedy in this tale. Some of it stretched and strained my ability to suspend disbelief. But, to be honest, the discussion of modern marriage is the best part of the novel. Science fiction allows authors to use an alien's perspective to examine the frailties of humanity, and this author uses it to place a spotlight on our divorce ridden culture.As a romance, Suddenly a Bride is just okay, but for social commentary, it gets five stars.","P.

As an example, he's an alien and he goes to the hospital. Were our devices not capable of detecting the differences of the species? What about the differences of the baby when they were evaluating her? Those are facts that could have fed further plot ideas, pushing this onward in a conceivable way - yet this plot is very thin, and while I read it to the end to see how it turned out, I really wanted to send her meddling, ridiculous mother on a spaceship on a one way trip into the nearest black hole. Even the way the main character accepts her ""fate"" as being bound to this alien being is not sold to the reader in the story, in a way that's decipherable.While I didn't like this book and rated it as such, I want to commend this author for trying to write something like this. That attempt deserves some recognition. I just wish it was more fleshed out, the world building and melding of worlds/cultures was given more weight in this story. The bones are there, but it's missing the flesh of the why/how of this situation, and how his presence on our world is so readily undetected, or why her friends and family accept her situation so readily, given possible fears about her well being.

Not to say that there is no conflict!  There is that, but its resolution happens without an undue amount of angst because the two main characters are unselfish, thoughtful and mature about it when the conflict from without their relationship happens.Honestly, this one felt more like a contemporary romance with science fiction elements than a straight sci-fi romance.  Yes, the hero is from another planet and yes there are some differences, but much of the story is that of a couple dealing with the fall-out off an arranged marriage without as much fall-out as there could have been.I enjoyed both characters very much.  I know some would say that Caitlin accepted matters way too fast and yeah she did on an emotional level, but the facts were staring her in the face and she had reached a place in her life where she wanted a home with husband and family so she was in a good mindset for Rilo/Chris' sudden appearance.  And hey, what's not to like about Chris, he was the perfect husband- gentle, sweet, loving, selfless and full of grateful appreciation just to have a wife.Now Caitlin's mother was another story.  She was classic 'mother in law' villain, but not just to Chris.  She seemed to have some hidden agenda for breaking up her own daughter's happiness more than anything.  I wish her motives would have been teased out more because for the life of me I couldn't figure out what her deal was.  I got her hurt at hearing about a wedding after the fact, but it went waaay beyond that.  Maybe its explained more in the next book.All in all, it was a pleasant reading experience that will warm your heart without tugging harshly on all your emotions.

I understand her contradictory feelings where she wanted Cole but felt disgusted with herself because of it, but did she really have to go on about it throughout the whole book? That put me off. The chemistry between Cole and Dana is very apparent since they met in High School which was way before either one of them got bit yet she doesn't realize this.

6145611,1490313281,5,Fan-Freaking-Tastic! I Loved This Book,A2TFGYCEVHXU6W,"[0, 0]","Where do I start - I LOVED this book! This has easily made its way into My Favorite Books categories and Shey Stahl is definitely in My Favorite Authors category as well. This is the second book of Ms. Stahl's that I have read and I am officially going to read everything she has ever written and anything she ever writes now.The book starts when Parker O'Neil moves to Washington to work at Rowan's step father's garage when they are only 17 years old. This part of the book reminded me of young, innocent love that was filled with winks, shy smiles and very little conversation. Parker and Rowan's relationship was very underwhelming at first - months went by without them ever speaking to one another. It isn't until they go on a road trip that summer with Parker's brother and Rowan's best friend that they finally open up to one another and fall in love.The first half of the book detailed their young love in full glory - their first kiss, first awkward time together, immaturity, inability to deal with love at such a young age and their utter lack of communication. I loved every part of this stage of their relationship. It reminds me of being young and thinking I knew everything, but really knowing nothing. Ms. Stahl did such a fantastic job illustrating the awkwardness of being a teenager and the emotions that teens, especially teen girls, go through.But like all good things, they sometimes don't last forever. Parker is a Supercross/Motorcross (he rides dirt bikes competitively) racer and leaves Washington to follow his dream. Their emotional immaturity seems to rule here and catapults them down a path that leads to pain, heart break, jealousy, lack of communication and avoidance. The remaining part of the book spans over 12 years where we follow Rowan and Parker as they navigate their tumultuous relationship - some good and some bad.The book spends the majority of the time being told from Rowan's perspective and if you've read any of my previous reviews, you know that I despise characters that do not communicate and run away from their problems. Here's the shocker -- and I may very well be a hypocrite -- but I didn't mind Rowan. I actually liked her. Was she stupid, petty, and immature at times? YES. But, she knew it - she was just in denial for the longest time. Did I want her to wake up and stop getting in her own way? YES - but what fun would this book be if there wasn't angst? Deep down Rowan always knew Parker was the love of her life - it just takes her a LONG time to finally admit that to herself.And then there's Parker. Oh Parker - he was so sweet and shy, which made him so different than any other male characters I've read about lately. I loved when I got to hear from his perspective - especially towards the end of the book. And did I mention he is a Supercross/Motocross superstar? I didn't know much about that world prior to reading this book, but Ms. Stahl has definitely opened my eyes to a fascinating world that I want to know more about. Picturing Parker on his bike and doing all his tricks - hot!The only minor thing about this book that confused me was the whole Kayla storyline. I got confused towards the end about what exactly happened between Kayla and Rowan and Kayla's role in Parker's life. I don't know if it was as if something was in the story but then later cut, but I feel like I missed a piece of the puzzle that contributed to Parker and Rowan's separation. Or maybe that part just totally went over my head. Either way it wasn't a huge deal - I just wished I understood a little bit better.I can't complete this review without talking about Ms. Stahl's writing. I LOVE her writing style. I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is about it that I love so much, but I just love the way she tells a story. Maybe its that she wrote this book as if Rowan was looking back at her life and interjected commentary about her decision-making. Maybe its that she sets her stories in worlds that are not commonly written about. Maybe its that she can really capture her characters' emotions.I cannot recommend and gush about this book enough.

""I'm not saying that I assume that's what you are, but just so you know...if you want to be at some point."" Then as the book progresses we see him come out of his shell, ""it's not that I don't want to do something about it...f***."" He let out a deep sigh, gesturing south to the hardness between us. ""I want that...badly. But...I don't want you to think less of me. I just kissed you for the first time last night..."" his eyes opened, searching mine ""...now here I am wanting to have sex with you...right now."" I mean as they get to know each other he REALLY comes out of his shell, ""As much as I want to hear those moans get louder...and as much as I want you..."" he kissed along my collarbone, his hands grasping the sides of my face. ""...we can't do this on my bike. For one, it's not really safe...and two...well, there are people all around us. I'd rather them not see you naked."" He's protective of his woman wants the nakedness all to himself. They also have an interesting way of communicating, ""Because I pulled your hair, and you punched my junk with your knee. It still hurts and we could really hurt ourselves in here."" The boy has a jealousy streak and it is HOT, ""Yes, I'm jealous. Crazy effing jealous that I can't even see straight! But I'm also not going to stand back and let you make the biggest mistake of your life because I know you feel this too.."" he motioned between us ""...you do want me, and that's why you turned to him to try and forget me.

I can say with certainty that this is a FANTASTIC read, I read it in one day, as I do with all of Shey's books! I loved the writing, the characters, etc. There were some very sweet, romantic moments in the book, but also are some very steamy, sexy moments. Somehow Shey manages to write this wonderful book, that you fall in love with without ever becoming smut. The love scenes in the book never cross a line, and it is just a really unforgettable read. Parker is a young boy, who has lost his parents at a very early age; he is trying to start over, and upon first glance seems very shy. Ro is a young girl who, is working in a shop with a bunch of men, and her BFF, who just wants to get out of the small town she grew up in. Ro is drawn to this new boy, and here begins the story that we all fall head over heels with within the first pages of the book. This story is not a simple story; it is, as frustrating and powerful as real life, and your first real love. Ro and Parker are far from perfect, and there is plenty of tearful, I want to pull my hair out, stomp my foot like toddler having a tantrum moments. But this being said, this is what makes for a great story, as in my opinion, love is not easy, ever! At times, ok a lot of times, while reading I wanted to grab Ro and shake her, but I understood her emotions more than I care to admit. I fell in love with Ro and Parker while reading this, and it is now on my list of favorites EVER!! I will re-read this story over and over and over again. Thanks again to Shey for writing yet another unforgettable story! If you have not read this book, and you are reading this review, stop, and one-click right now, you will love it I know it!!!""

Like I said, I get what the intent was with the inflict, but it seemed like it just never really got there in the story. And I still can't see justification for Rowan failing to be there for Parker in his time of need.There were some redeeming qualities. Parker is far from a typical alpha male.

It was a great story, but I couldn't say it was the ""one"" that would keep me coming back. But this? This will keep me coming back!Shey is a talented writer, I saw that in Waiting for You. In Everything Changes she went from just another indie author to a girl who can compete with the big releases. She really honed in her amazing ability.The story was emotionally charged. I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I really, really wanted to slap Ro. A lot. Ro kept them apart for years. Yes, Parker made a choice, but Ro never gave him the chance to make it work. However, she had her reasons, and it was understandable. As a young girl in love, she made a lot of poor choices when it came to the relationship. But, who didn't as a teenager? Parker wasn't perfect, but he kept the tie. Whether or not she understand why he was doing it, he kept her around. She never took a proactive approach in it, just waited. But, like I said, she had her reasons. Reasons anybody could understand.When Ro declared to the reader, not Parker, she was in love with Parker after a few short encounters I wanted to roll my eyes. I almost put the book down. Then I realized (a little slow on the uptake, I know) this story was being told as a memory. Ro was walking us through the past, but from the future. Yes, a teenager would throw the L-Bomb out quickly, which is why I don't typically read YA. To me, I felt Ro was more telling us from the future when she thought that love started. Maybe I'm completely wrong and she was just being an emotional teenager.I've only ever seen one other book that was able to pull that story-telling off. The whole I'm-in-the-future-telling-the-story thing was well done by Megan Hart in Switch. Usually, it just gets confusing. Shey pulled it off, her little hints throughout that things may be different now really made me want to just jump ahead and read.And I did. I couldn't take it.

He breathed, I inhaled and everything changed.""I must start off by saying I am a huge fan of Shey Stahl, I have been ever since I was introduced to Jameson Riley. Therefore whenever a new book of hers comes out I dance with glee. (quite literally most times ;)) I love the incorporation of sports in Shey's books and Everything Changes was no exception. I feel like I not only get a love story but an education each time I read one, especially with my practically non existent sports knowledge. :)I felt Everything Changes was set to a slower pace than Shey's previous books, we weren't submerged in the professional side of the AMA Supercross racing, the focus was very much on the relationship between Rowan and Parker. I loved the build up of their relationship. Shey captured a beautiful summer between two impressionable seventeen year olds sharing a lot of firsts together. I loved it and I loved Rowan and Parker together, I almost felt I was reading it with a heavy heart as I knew with the title that changes were coming and I didn't want anything to happen to this sweet couple. (I do get rather attached ;)) But Parker had dreams of competing professionally and that meant travelling whilst Rowan had school to finish and a shop to run with her Dad. So the inevitable happened and Parker took off to compete.Rowan and Parker continued to torture themselves with a not-quite-on-but-not-quite-off relationship. I really wanted to knock their heads together at this point. I was desperate for them to talk to each other. All this acting shy and hiding their real feelings was going to be the end of me. I was rooting for them since day one. Then of course there was the introduction of Sean, he was only trying to offer comfort to Rowan in her loneliness (Sean was the third party therefore by default I had to take an instant dislike to him even though he was perfectly nice. Meh, sorry dude.)Parker and Rowan's relationship continued to go back and forth, both of them not admitting what they wanted, the story dipped in the middle for me and I did tire of them avoiding their situation and causing all this heartache to each other. I wanted both of them to be stronger and Rowan's indecisiveness just about killed me (Just tell him already girl!) And then there was poor Sean, I couldn't believe the guy would stick around for 4 years knowing Rowan's heart and body belong to someone else. He must have had the patience of a saint.I loved the supporting cast in Everything Changes, Parker and Rowan as well as her friend Addy and Parker's brother Justin didn't have perfect family backgrounds and I found them endearing, both couples found solace in their other half. Rowan's parents as well as Justin and Parker's were a great addition to the story as well as Parker's friend Kurt. I enjoyed the interaction between them all.Like all of Shey's books I loved her writing. I did feel my attention wavering at points and because this was a long book I felt it could have been condensed in parts to keep the momentum going. Parker and Rowan were great (albeit at times very frustrating) characters who had shown a lot of growth over the time span of the story. Although I wasn't as perhaps completely consumed by this story compared to Shey's previous books, it was definitely still a good read and I can't wait for the next one! ~Ava",Ava & Brianna @ Biblio Belles

One is on the verge of stardom and the other is trying to cope with the changes it will bring into their lives.

Actually I liked Rowan in the beginning but by the middle more so closer to the end I HATED her! What basically pushed me over to hate her was when Parker had that HORRIBLE HORRIBLE accident and she didn't call to check on him and didn't go visit him to the hospital!!! Like even after Kurt begged her and everyone else for that matter she didn't. KNOWING how bad that accident was KNOWING that he could of died and she didn't go and her reasoning and logic was stupid dumber than stupid!! Then what added the cherry on top of the ""I Hate Rowan"" Sundae was the whole situation with Sean.......*****SPOILER ALERT******Like she doesn't even love Sean but she accepts his marriage proposal EVEN after Parker begs her not to marry him multiple times. She is still all ""I don't know"" like literally up to the day of the wedding!!! Like she is STILL trying to decide between Sean and Parker the love of her life?!*****END OF SPOILER ALERT*****Rowan is only with Sean because of he is ""Safe"" and the level in which she allows their relationship to go is just plain ole stupid to me. SHE, Rowan is the reason why her and Parker aren't together throughout the book! Parker has expressed his love for her multiple times and she still runs and when we get down to the meat and the potatoes of ""Why?"" smh her reasoning is just plain ole head full of nothing but air dumb! Smh I just couldn't with Rowan and even though the author's style of writing is nice.... this book didn't do it for me. The author didn't even make Rowan's reason good enough to understand WHY she did what she did. Parker was just hmp all kinds of awesome and his character alone is why I finished the book granted he was written a little to fictional for fiction(Being with no one sexually after Rowan). He was still awesome and WHY he went to the lengths he did for Rowan was beyond me. So just when I'm thinking I'm reading the last chapter I find myself reading 3 more and they honestly weren't even necessary. In my opinion I say borrow this book don't buy it because I'm 85% sure if you are over the age of 25 you won't like this book.","Book Nerd ""Book Nerd"""

It is a one of kind book that speaks from the heart with some very funny moments.  Shey's writing style draws you in so that you feel as if you are right there in the room with her characters.  I loved that I was never comfortable enough to know what would happen right up to the last page.  This is a book with a complete story that I will remember forever.",CABorgford

Not my thing, that is until I met Parker O'Neil, the shy 17 year old boy who starts working at Rowen ""Ro"" Jensen's dad's garage. Rowen was instantly attracted to Parker, but she is shy and thinks she is not someone who could catch his eye. Addy, Rowens best friend, and Parker's brother end up becoming close, and the boys are going to Utah to get some riding in for a few weeks on summer vacation. Addy talks Rowen into go and her dad Rick agrees. Addy and Justin are quick to hit it off which leads Parker and Rowen alone, both of them are so shy, but at night when the moon is out they can finally talk. You find out that Parker is just as attracted to Rowen as she is to him, the summer heats up and you feel like you are there with them, the awkwardness of the first time, falling in love for the first time, and how things are so much different when you are away from home then when you come home and reality hits. Parker ends up getting his Yamaha sponsorship back, and Rowen lets him go, believing that she isn't what she needs and walks away. This story goes through 5 years of Rowen and Parker's relationship and you feel for them the heartache Rowen goes through only seeing or hearing from Parker every so often, the love she has for him (even though she won't admit it) and the pain she feels, you cry with her, you get depressed with her and you love with her. She tries to move on, and thinks she is doing the right thing, she lets other people tell her what Parker is doing and who Parker is without actually talking to him, you want to slap her at times, and you want to hug her other times.Everything comes to a head, and its heartbreaking, you start asking yourself and the book (or in my case my Kindle) how could you? Why are you doing this? Why can't you just say how you feel, instead of doing the opposite. This book was an emotional roller-coaster for me, and I loved every second of it. You do get tiny peaks of what is going on in Parker's head towards the end, and I LOVED IT!!! You realize throughout the five years  (and more) that this story goes everything changes, it can change for the better, change for the worse, but no matter what things change, people change, and sometimes it is downright ugly, and sometimes it is the most amazing thing you could possibly ever experience. This is the story of young love, losing everything you thought was important to you, and gaining the most important things in the end. You learn the power of friendship, first loves, and the uncertainty we all feel about what is next.This was a definite unexpected favorite book for me, and I am now a huge Shey Stahl fan, I will read anything by her as the 2 books I've read so far I have loved every second of it, I wont shy away from her book if it is about a sport I'm not found of (or know nothing about), she has a way of making you love these characters and pulling at your heart strings, and taking you into the story, that when you finish, you sit back and say ""WOW!!"". When you pick up this book to start reading, make sure you have time to finish it, I had a hard time putting this book down all weekend, and now wish I would have drug it out more because it's over and I want more!",chrissycf

I know it takes two in any relationship, but I hold her responsible for a lot of the issues in her and Parker 's relationship. She could've changed the direction and everything could've been great. When he had to leave, she immediately tried to break things off and then blame him! Where is the love and determination?! Oh and I don't get how she tells Sean she can't marry him when Parker has her heart, yet she she showed up with her dress in hand . She was going to marry him, but only decided otherwise when Sean called her out. UGH. She didn't deserve Parker. That aside, this book was great!!!!! The writing style kept my attention. I really felt the chemistry between Parker and Rowan and I liked them together when Rowan wasn't  being a dumb.. Parker was a sweetheart, who wasn't  without his faults. He definitely needed to work on his communication skills. Both characters had issues, but the reality is, their issues were real. frustration aside, I guess that's why I loved the book so much...

Every step, every breath, every choice, and every word leads you to another moment in your life that will change you.'God damn that was exhausting & frustrating as hell. Anyone who knows me knows I love a healthy amount of angst, but this one was on the border of almost too much- almost. I came close to knocking a star off cause I spent sooo much time pissed off at Ro, her actions & decisions BUT that wouldn't be fair to the book or the author. It was still an awesome book & the fact that it & it's characters pulled such strong emotions out of me shows what an amazing author this is.Still...it was painful.'When the ground shifts beneath you and everything you thought you once knew changes, can you handle it or do you collapse?I couldn't-that much was evident-and I collapsed face first into the dirt.'This is the story of Parker, the AMA Supercross racer who moves to a small town with his brother Justin following the death of their father. They get a job at a garage where they meet Rowen & Addy. Rowen's father owns the garage &Addy; is her best friend. Ro is immediately drawn to Parker though he barely says two words to her. Not because he's not interested, everyone but Ro seems to know he is, but because he is painfully shy (which seriously was cute as hell). Everything changes when the four of them take a trip together that summer. Ro didn't realize Addy & Justin were secretly dating for the last month, so when they instantly pair off it leaves Parker & Ro with no choice but to finally talk to each other. The first half of this book is spent watching these two fall in love. It was beautiful & awkward & sweet yet frustrating.'When it happened, I saw stars and fairy dust and unicorns. My brain felt like pure mush. The warm lava spreading through me settled nicely throughout my entire body, his warm skin like hot coals burning against me.'I kinda feel bad saying this but the first couple of ""sexy scenes"" made me giggle. I do NOT miss the awkwardness of losing my virginity Lol but it was sweet & real too.""Please don't knee me in the junk."" His smile was bright even in the moonlight.I laughed moved towards the bed. ""Only if you promise to pull my hair a little.""But they were only seventeen and communication was a word they clearly didn't understand. Unfortunately, that held true for most of the book. Sooo much crap could have been avoided if either one of them would have just opened their damn mouths & spoke what was on their minds. Still, watching them together that first summer was pretty great. But then Parker gets offered a sponsorship from Yamaha & heads back to the track. That's when the angst sets in. We spend the majority of the second half of the book watching the next five years of their lives unfold and it. Was. PAINFUL. They loved each other so very much but they could not get their heads together, they hurt each other time & again seemingly unable to stop themselves. This is where I really started to lose my patience with Ro. I wanted to smack the ever lovin hell outta her so friggin often it drove me NUTS. Some of the choices she made were so off the wall WTF is she thinking that I was shaking my kindle ready to throw it against the wall & poor Parker couldn't seem to get out of his own way long enough to just tell her & SHOW HER exactly what he wanted from her. By the time they pulled it together I was almost ready to just walk away screaming. See what I mean about the strong emotions? But I still loved it, does that make me mental or just a masochist?! The last handful of chapters were needed to calm me the hell down & mend my battered heart. I was very happy with how it ended, glad to see the growth & maturity that came from all that heartache. I do love this author & highly recommend this book, just be prepared for the overdose of angst.Booze would be helpful, just sayin'  ;)'Everything changes in life, all the time too, but then there are the times when they change for the better.With time you get older and wiser and it comes easier to you.Change isn't always bad.

Shey Stahl is super talented in created characters so real, so lifelike, and so relate-able, that you can't help but fall in love with them.  But that also means that when they screw up or are so out of touch with the reality of the situation that they can't see the truth, you end up grunting in frustration at them!  That's what I did at least.  I found myself loving Parker and loving Ro but but getting so frustrated by their actions that I wished they were real people so I could give them a dose of truth.  Thank goodness for Ro's friends Addy and Justin!This book has lovably, flawed characters, romance, a little heartache thrown in to the mix, as well as humor.  Because it sucks you in within the first chapter, you won't be able to put the book down so you should probably buy the book and start reading it on a day where you have nothing to do or at night when you don't have to get up early the next day because you'll most likely stay up all night finishing it.The only complaint I have is that I feel the ending of the story was wrapped up a little too quickly.

I fell madly in love with her writing with Waiting For You and I have been a FANGIRL since!  So when Kim asked me to be on this tour I didn't think twice...Every Thing Changes is a beautiful story.  I fell hard and fast for Parker which made me feel like a creep because he was only 17 at the time the book started...  Parker is pretty broken and that is probably why I was so smitten with him, I seem to always fall for the broken ones and want to hug them and make it all better... I'm crazy I know but seriously there is nothing about this story that won't tug at your heart strings and make you feel the same.Parker loves racing, it's all he's ever loved and how he spends all of his free time.  Until he meets a girl... Rowan is sweet, kind and super shy just like Parker, and she turns his world upside down! He watches her from afar but never really speaks to her. Until his brother invites her and her best friend to travel with them for a few weeks in the summer and this will be, the first of many times that everything changes for Parker.Rowan has been watching Parker since the day that he walked into her dad's shop.  She won't talk to him because she is shy and lacks experience, when it comes to boys.  Rowan has led a tough life herself, and she is probably just as broken as Parker.  When she is invited to travel for a few weeks with Parker, his brother and her best friend, she is reluctant but excited.  Finally able to get out of her small town and have some fun for a change.  What she doesn't know is that everything will change for her after this trip.The path that follows after the summer is rough, sweet and full of doubts, passion and heartbreak...What I love about this book is... EVERYTHING!  It's real and honesty and raw at times.  It breaks through barriers of trust and love and follows what teenagers really are like at the young age of 17.  Think they know everything but really know nothing.  What do they know about true love and sacrifice at 17.  Just about nothing.  So as they age and mature they realize everything changes except how they feel about each other.  The bond they formed that first summer simply can't be broken no matter time or circumstances that try to break them apart.They both make some really poor and really selfish choices throughout the book and I was frustrated at times at both of them.  But never thought, oh that wouldn't ever happen.  Not once...The BEST part of this book (don't think that I'm creepy here) was the first sexual encounter... I'll tell you why!  It was completely accurate and real!  First book in forever that didn't glamorize the first time.  I get tired of reading books that say that the first time was amazing and so wonderful, it's supposed to be awkward and painful... I cannot commend her enough for her portrayal of that moment... sigh...This book gets my 5 star seal of approval.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough!

6145661,1490313281,5,All nighter,A2ON53GR80JS8S,"[11, 13]","I loved Everything Changes for many reasons and stayed up all night last reading it.  It was worth the discomfort I am experiencing today because of lack of sleep. It was recommended on an Amazon thread that listed names of YA books where the H & h losing their virginity to each other.THIS REVIEW IS FILLED WITH SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS My only hesitation in reading it was I thought it was inevitable that the Parker, the H & Rowan, the h, would eventually separate and sleep with other people.  In reality, many people, sleep and/or date more than one person during their lifetime.  Here the H & h are young, 17 when they date and lose their virginity together. There are periods of time that they are separated.  The only other contemporary romance book that I read where the H&h; lost their virginity together and the H did not sleep with other people after being each others first was Fall into You by Jasinda Wilder. In Fall into You, it was different because they never were apart and the first H died young, at 18.  Therefore I thought for sure that during the about 10 year period the H and probably the h would take other lovers.  While the h came close and the H really tried to sleep with other women but just couldn't, neither did and I loved that. It had a brief love triangle with Rowan and Parker and her finance and while I usually like those I did not like the way Rowan treated her finance.  She strung him along way too long, I believe it was 4 years.Another thing I loved about the book was the Parker was crazy about Rowan and even though he tried, he could not let her go, even though they were separated during long periods of time. At times Parker showed jealousy which I loved. While I still liked Rowan, I could have slapped her several times.  First when she abandoned the Parker when he was very seriously hurt and needed her with him to for support and get better.  She did not see him, did not write and did not call. It was selfish and cruel behavior, no matter how afraid she was of getting hurt.  Also, while neither were blameless for the separations and lack of communication, Rowan took too long to recognize how Parker felt about her, keeping them apart much longer than was reasonable.  Also even when she recognized how he loved her, she will was afraid of being with him. She dumped her finance the day of the wedding, even though she again slept with Rowan.Another thing I enjoyed about this book is that it expanded over a period of time and there was a HEA. There was a decent length epilogue that reassured me that they would always be together.  In addition, I saw only a few grammar mistakes and the book flowed well. There were no parts that dragged.  While the story was mainly from Rowan's point of view, occasionally it was from Park's, giving the readers glimpses of how he was feeling. That made the book more interesting.  The only thing I did not like about the book other than Rowan's occasional behavior discussed above, is that Parker returned to professional motorcycle racing.  He was already very seriously injured once and it worried me that he would be again as I see the sport as dangerous. I am hoping that he would eventually stop racing.  There is hope for that because when the book ended he was only in his mid twenties and that he may not want to race when he was older.  In summary, I thing the author did an excellent job and would readily read more of her books.","Justirishgirl ""aut viam inveniam aut faciam"""

But once I started, I just could not put it down. It begins when two small town girls Rowan and Addy meet two brothers Parker and Justin. The girls work at Rowan's Step-Dad's mechanic shop and the boys are immersed in the world of Motocross racing as well as being mechanics.(Quote)My mom, Sarah, used to tell me that you could be anywhere when your life begins but you wouldn't know it until it changed everything you thought you knew. When she said it at the time, the phrase didn't have much meaning to me. Seeing Parker O'Neil, I finally understood what she meant.I found it so endearing that while Addy and Justin did not have too much trouble pairing up, Rowan and Parker were both socially inept, quiet, and awkward. They literally circle around each other but never speak. But Addy and Justin come up with a plan for them all to spend a few weeks at the track in Moab together and everything changes. It does not change overnight. It was almost painful for them to be in each others presence and have such difficulty communicating effectively. But but you can tell that they really do like each other, but they just don't know how to express it. I loved seeing them begin to open up, find their way, share firsts, and begin to start a relationship. And I found it refreshing that things were still awkward and not perfect and that they had to literally fumble through it and find their way together. But then once again everything changes and they're perfect summer could not last.""I shouldn't say I'm not shy. Sometimes, yes I am, but with you...it's easier to be myself.""(Quote)He loved me. I knew that. I loved him, he knew that...but everything changed.Parker has to follow his dreams and they find themselves apart. Then they just have so many issues with distance, insecurities, fear, trust, and most of all lack of communication. We know they still love each other and belong together, but at the same time they just cannot get it together. When they were together, they were okay temporarily, but when they were apart they were a big mess. But they just could not find a way to stay together and both be happy.""I sit and wait for everything to change, so I can run back to you, be with you like I'm the only one""""You are the only one...I know how you feel. I know because I live for the moment I hear your voice when you answer...and everything changes for me. I live for the hello.""I adored Parker! I did from the beginning even when he barely communicated. His quiet, shy demeanor, his vulnerability, his edginess, and the fact that he was involved in Motocross was so intriguing. He had been damaged by tragedies in his past and had walls built up. I thought that even though he was trying to follow his dreams, he really tried not to leave Ro behind. He had good morals, was very caring, loving and willing to share his feelings. Even though he still had issues with making sure he was communicating especially long distance(yeah, he kind of screwed up with this a few times). I loved that he knew what he wanted even when both of the things he wanted most had trouble co-existing and that he stayed true to his feelings even when presented with temptations.But Ro...She just drove me crazy sometimes! There were so many times that I just wanted to smack her. Granted in the beginning it was easy to understand because she was young, innocent, immature and insecure. I actually liked her then. And they did have a rough time with separation that changed her. But as they were distanced and it dragged on in time, I felt that she was just in denial, selfish, inconsiderate of people's feelings, and at times just hurtful. She hid behind of all of the issues and made poor choices. She wanted to be with him, but at the same time pushed him away and ran. And I hated it when she was not there when he really needed her. It got to a point where I literally just wanted to shake her and make her see what she was doing to poor Parker. But eventually she started to grow up too and I was able to forgive her.And Parker was not completely innocent and perfect either. They both had a lot of growing up to do and had to really figure out what they both wanted and needed. And most of all learn to be honest and communicate!(Quote)To understand the connection we had, words wouldn't suffice. No more than the truth being spoken, the truth in what we were, what we'd become when everything changed.This book was a wonderful sweet and emotional read and was full of angst, drama, pain, heartache, and love. It was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions and drama, but it was engaging and I thoroughly loved it! Shey Stahl created endearing, deep, damaged characters and a story that just pulls you in and won't let you go. And you take this long journey with them and feel like you have watched them grow up and mature. The supporting characters were equally likable and entertaining including Justin, Addy, her parents, his family, and the other mechanics. They all had a good rapport and really felt like an extended family that you would like to be a part of. And there were some not so likable characters too that added to the drama and that just made you want to run over them with a bike. I loved getting to see Parker's POV more towards the end of the book. And was actually sad to see the book come to a close.(Quote)Change. It could happen in the blink of an eye and it wasn't always bad, sometimes change was good. Sometimes it showed you where you were meant to be all along.",K. Bias

They were great when their relationship was in a good place but the bad places were oh so bad. I wanted to shake sense into Rowen every single time she could not say what she needed to say! Parker was absolutely no better, he drove me nuts with his non-verbal communication. The only negative part of the book to me was how far Rowen goes to try and forget Parker, yeah I didn't like that part at all. :( Let's just say Shey really knows how to keep you hoping for them to pull their heads out, but sometimes I would think they were never going to get it together. Just when I thought this cannot end well, she brought that hope into it again and I was right back where I started, hoping for the HEA.....did they finally get it?

It's not even that there were a ton of twists or turns. The story just was five years of simply not communicating. SOOOOOOOO FRUSTRATING!The story spans over 8 or so years and is told mainly from Rowan's POV. Rowan is young. Many books in this genre have 17 year olds that act like they are in their mid twenties. Not so with Rowan. She is 17, acts like she's 17, and has the emotional maturity of a 17 year old. (In my head, this completely accounts for the depressing tone of the book...anyone who has been around a heart broken 17 yr. old I'm sure would agree.)Rowan is not only 17, but she is a small town girl. She has a mother who is not all there and a step father that loves both Rowan and her mom. The summer before her senior year, she falls in love with Parker, a motor cross racer. Parker is an extremely talented rider, but also is shy, withdrawn, and probably the most non-communicative guy there is. When Parker does say something, you really have to read into it to get even a glimpse at the depth of feeling he tries to convey. (I'm sure you can see the problem coming from a mile away.) At 17, Rowan lacks the self assurance and maturity to really understand what Parker tries to tell her and, as result, they spend the next five years in non-relationship hell.I really did appreciate the fact that the book didn't just end, but we were allowed to get a glimpse of where the ending lead. I also appreciated (view spoiler) It really spoke to the romantic in me.Rating the book was difficult for me. The tone just really did a number on me and not in a good way.

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! It was a highly addictive tale, with a male lead that literally stole center stage.Parker was the ultimate book boyfriend. Athletic, faithful, loving, and determined to win the girl. There wasn't a single moment I was angry with him, or doubting his intentions. If anything, I found myself frustrated with Ro-- his love interest.Never-the-less, despite her lack of belief in Parker at times, and her inability to take what she wanted from life more often than not, Ro was still a character I was drawn to as well. With her viewpoint dominating most of the first half of the book, the suspense was overwhelming as to where things would wind up. I have to say, Stahl did an excellent job of captivating me, the reader. I was holding my breath right along with Ro. Feeling what she felt, and fearing what she feared, for a while there. The uncertainty was, at times, too much; then came relief. Such sweet relief.Read this book! It's a winner, in every way! Some minor editing flaws, but nothing that took away from what was ultimately fantastic writing on Stahl's part. I look forward to many more of her works.",Kristine

I can honestly say this book gave me the classic misty eyes.  Which doesn't happen very often for me.  This also was my first book by Shey Stahl and certainly not my last.Parker and Rowan start their romance when in high school.  They are very young and inexperienced, but as teenagers are unable to keep their hands off one another.  They fall deeply in love with each other over one spectacular summer.  Unfortunately sometimes good thing don't last.  Parker is offered a sponsorship with Yamaha through the AMA supercross and has to leave.  They part ways and for a long three months they don't talk.  They are both miserable.  Until one of them gives in.  That is when their tortured dance begins.  They see one another off and on for five years.  Whenever Parker calls Rowan can not resist.  This certainly isn't the ideal situation for a couple head over heals for each other.  During this time they have some good times and some pretty awful ones too.  Will their love survive their tumultuous journey?  Or will everything change?I enjoyed watching Parker and Rowan's love blossom and grow through this story.  We witness some really awkward firsts for this couple.  They learn along the way what makes their relationship work.  Now obviously it can't be all rainbows and butterflies for this couple.  They are plenty of major road  blocks they encounter.  I have to say the dialogue between these two was very beautiful.  Parker was always honest about his feelings.  No hidden agenda was in the mix.  It was actually very refreshing to read their story.  These two were so comfortable with each other.  The saying distance makes the heart grow founder was very true for them.This is a must read story of first love and holding on to it.  As in the title of the book Everything Changes, but the more things change the more they stay the same.  What I loved the most about this book was that love was constant and never faltered.  If you didn't believe in true love, you will now after reading this story.",mary tatar

I fell in love with Shey's writing style in Waiting for You and loved the Racing on the Edge series as well. Everything Changes made me crazy...in a good way! You know a book is good when you want to jump into the story and shake the characters so they wake up and see that they were meant for each other. Parker is the perfect book boyfriend...HAWT, sweet, a little mysterious and he rides motorcycles for a living! Doesn't get any hotter than that! Rowan was definitely a frustrating heroine who I really wanted to smack upside the head sometimes, but I loved her and Parker together. The story of them coming together and finding each other was so sweet and I love that Shey wasn't afraid to make it REAL. Losing your virginity is awkward and painful not magical with multiple orgasms! I love the humor she put into those first love scenes and the way their new love made me feel. I am 40 years old and I could totally imagine being 17 and experiencing all of those things again for the first time....sigh.

6145694,1490313281,5,Buy This Book!,A2KMIZNKC8YNFA,"[1, 1]","Everything Changes is a book you don't want to miss!  As with all the books Shey Stahl writes this is the newest in her collection of racing and young romance and the trials young couples go through with the added angst of having a professional motorcycle racer as a boyfriend.Rowan and Parker are the couple many of us can relate to when remembering our first love, and while I don't know many of us who are still with that first love there is still something so special and poignant about that time that nothing can change it.  It's the first touch, the first kiss, and of course the first time you have sex with that love.  Shey writes such basic emotions that it's beautiful to read and experience.  One moment I have to turn on the A/C the next I have the box of tissue in my hand.Even if you don't have the first clue about any type of racing Shey has put in definitions of common racing terms in every chapter so you can relate them to what you are reading.  By the end you can easily have a conversation using those terms which is a bonus!The characters come alive on the pages and you feel like you can see the blue of Parkers eyes and the muscles of his chest as you read.  All the characters are so well developed you walk away knowing the entire family.  I love that she adds the details of things that may have been traumatic in her characters early lives into the books as well.So take it from a Shey Stahl fan, if you like romance pick up this book, if you like a good story, pick up this book, if you like the steam, pick up this book and most of all if you want to read a book that has a story that you wont forget as soon as you close it BUY THIS BOOK!",Mickey

They were so young they couldn't get there s*** together they couldn't really realize what they were risking, or how they needed to communicate better.  Parker didn't think he'd be risking their love when he took the opportunity to go back to Motocross.Can their young love survive the uncertainty? God I sure hoped so! I had so many moments where I was all like YAY..only to be left moments later going..wait what?I wanted so badly for so many different things. Love can be a painful thing, they were so young and sweet and had such an amazing connection.

I sometimes didn't like Rowan's way of thinking. I spent a good amount of time yelling at her. I got how she could come to some of the conclusions she did, because insecurities effect us all at some point, but had she just been a bit more forward/demanding I'd have been happier. And the second thing: I wished there had been more chapters from Parker's point of view.All of that said, this book was amazing! Rarely will I find a book that really brings in some realistic situations, and this is the first time that I've read a book which revolves around one of my favorite sports! That alone had me giving it 3 stars. But what really sealed the deal was how it made me remember what it was like to be 17 again, and just how intense your feelings are at that age. It's very easy to let yourself get carried away and lost in feelings without really carrying how damaging things can be and Shey Stahl did a wonderful job in depicting this.I can honestly say that I loved the characters in this book. Parker was...well he was wonderful. Took him a bit to realize some things but in the end he fought hard for what he wanted and I loved that. Rowan's parents were awesome! And don't even get me started on Justin and Addy. Even though we didn't get to see much of their relationship unfold, there was still some details given that let you know they were absolutely adorable. I loved the honest friendship that Rowan and Addy had too. She never sugarcoated things for Rowan and she let her know exactly how she felt. That's exactly what best friends are for and I loved how that definitely shined through.As the book started to end I kept setting it down because I didn't want it to be over. (At 98% I had to put it down for the night in hopes of it magically being extended over night, lol!) The glimpse that Shey gives us into how this story ends was above and beyond though. I was absolutely in love with this ending. And yet so sad that it was over. I kept wishing for more chapters because I just wasn't ready to say goodbye. I could literally read about these characters forever.I've now become a forever fan of this author and her style of writing!",Raquel

I am not convinced they really loved each other, but for most of the book they were teenagers or little older and that was ok. This is not a tale of extraordinary meant-to-be deep-rooted forever-in-love emotions, in fact I read this book as that of two people strangely dancing around one another, not knowing why they did. I did not really see their behavior as plainly selfish, when it mostly was, I just saw it as the confused reactions of two people who did not know how to be together when they were not having sex. I think this reflects reality more so than most romance books and therefore did not really see the romance in this book. It is a good book though, quite a few typos and missing words, but still good when read as just a simple tale of two people who met young and how they got together in the end.","starsaga ""starsaga"""

6145719,1490313281,5,Everything Changes,AARUDG7R70WVV,"[0, 0]","When I read the synopsis, I knew this book was one I wanted to read. I really like the idea of a Supercross racer. There is just something so sexy about a guy who can fly through the air doing tricks on a dirt bike and land it!It starts off when brothers Parker and Justin O'Neal moved into town. Rowan works at her Dad's garage with her BFF Addy and they are instantly smitten with the boys when they walk into her Dad's shop. The boys start working there as mechanics. Parker is super quiet, shy and absolutely adorable. Rowan is crushing on him hard, but he never really talks to her. The occasional grin, or wink, but he never really talks. Justin and Addy hit it off and flirt all the time.After a little time, and flirting the girls go off with the boys on a trip and really get to know them better. Parker is still quiet but he slowly lets Rowan in when their alone together. Little by little their relationship grows, and so does their attraction.Motocross is all Parker has ever wanted to do, but he's had a troubled past and coming to their small town was something he did so he could remember why he loved the sport. Rowan helps him with that.She wants him to fulfill his dreams of being a pro rider. But when that happens, the lifestyle separates them.Depressed that Parker is gone she waits, waits for him to call. So much time goes by. But when he calls, she's there waiting. Every time he calls she's there waiting. Coming to him whenever he needs her to.What he really wants is for her to stay. On her own, without him asking or making her choose this lifestyle.What she really wants is for him to beg her to stay.They are sooo on the same wave lengths, and sooo off of them at the same time.They want the same exact thing, to be together. But neither one of them is willing to just SAY it to the other one. They drag this out over 5 years of time. Their love never fades. But they're breaking each others hearts at the same time.At first I thought this story might be a little young for me. In the beginning it seemed that way. But I was wrong. The Author merely wrote it like they were 17 years old (because they were)! But as they grew and got older so did the story.The intimacy in the beginning was frustrating at first, but I told myself she's writing it realistically. When they lost their virginities to each other, it was real. It wasn't perfect earth shattering sex. It was scary, nerve racking, painful, first time sex. lolBut as their relationship grew, so did the intimacy.I really enjoyed watching them learn and grow together as a couple. I felt butterflies because of how sweet Parker would be.Yes it was frustrating that so much seemed left unsaid because Parker wasn't a talker. But the point of it was that was who he was as a person, and the fact that Rowan related to him in spite of his awkward quietness, was what was beautiful about it all. He needed that kind of person, and she was it for him.I loved when Parker came out of his shell, in those rare moments you truly fell in love with him. He wasn't the bad boy I typically LOVE. Yes he had troubles, but it was his sweetness, and how he expressed it that made you adore him.Now, Rowan's character I did like, but I was annoyed with her during the end. I know that being apart from Parker was so hard for her. But I felt like she loved Parker way to much to have this guy Sean on the back burner. It didn't seem right to me. She was too obsessed and too in love for that in my opinion. I get that there needed to be another obstacle but that wasn't really believable to me.I  give this 5 stars because of how much I just thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the plot, even though some of it was just wishy washy for me.I don't rate books by mistakes in them either, because this is INDIE, and your going to have some mistakes. But some people would pry be annoyed with some of the mistakes in this book, I noticed missing words several times, and once a repeated sentence. This is stuff I look over. It doesn't bother me, but there are reviewers out there that would freak over that stuff.Over all I'm really happy that I read it. I really liked how it ended and truly enjoyed hearing few areas of Parkers point of view!","Sweetpea2322 ""Joleen"""

I laughed, I cried, and then I laughed. Crap I have never been so emotional over a book in a long time. I mean DAM this book was such an emotional journey that I never expected I was just taken by surprise. Shey is a great writer who pulls you in and keeps you right there in the moment. Man I have to say that I was right there every step of the way with Parker and Rowan. I loved how their relationship came to be and how it unfolded and how they had to both grow up and see things for what they were. They needed to stop living on fear and enjoy what they have.Parker is a shy guy that moves to another town after a tragedy in his life. His older brother Justin and him move in with family and decide they will make a go at this town they are in. Parker is the star of the brothers because he is an AMA Supercross Racer. He has won several titles and stopped racing for a while to get his head cleared. It is in this new town that he takes a job at the local body shop and meets the owners daughter Rowan or Ro as he calls her. Because Parker is shy and keeps everything bottled up inside Ro does not realize Parker likes her. As the school year winds down and the summer approaches Parker wants Ro to go with him on the road while he practices his racing. Ro agrees only because her best friend Addy is in love with Parker's older brother Justin.Ro is a quiet girl who works for her fathers body shop. She hangs with her best friend Addy and loves to take care of her sick mom. Addy has never had a boyfriend so when she feels something for Parker she is not sure what it is. AT first she thinks it is just a crush but as they get to know each other she realizes that it is love. She is excited that her and Addy are going to spend the summer with the O'Neil boys but she is nervous as well because she gets all flustered around Parker and can't seem to get words out to talk to him.As Addy and Ro get ready to go on the road for the summer Ro is about to realize her life is going to change and in a very big way. Ro realizes that Parker is her first love and she will do anything to hold on to him but she is also guarding her heart because she knows that Parker's first love is Supercross Racing. As the two develop a relationship and and try and find balance between them something happens that will rock their worlds and they will have to fight for what they want. But what happens when you don't know how to express yourself? What happens when the rubber meets the road and you have to make a decision between being comfortable or living on the edge.This story will rock you to the core of your being. If you are looking for a great love story this is it with all it's toss and turns and curve balls this is the BEST NA book I have read all year! This is a must read and I will read it again and again!","Tee ""TeeKyleJacobson"""

I kept on going and was glad I did as there needed to be a solid foundation for these two at 17 years old to understand what they go through over the years.  I also ended up liking that the years ticked by slowly instead of rushing the story.Parker is a AMA Supercross racer that is taking the summer away from the sport to clear his head.  He ends up working at the garage of Rowan's dad along with his brother Justin.  Rowan and her best friend Addy work in the office of the shop as well as the adjoining coffee shop.Parker and Rowan have eyes for each other, although they are both too shy to say saying.  He is quiet and really doesn't have much to say.  Parker has a past, which he has a hard time getting over.  Rowan is stuck in a small town, which she wants to change, but is scared of change.The lives of these two get extremely complicated and sad at times.  So much drama and angst between them, you just don't know if you can read more, but keep going.  We follow Parker and Rowan through their so-called relationship over the years as it ebbs and flows.  As they mature, the relationship grows in different directions whether they like it or not.I thought this book was well-written and the supporting characters were made to be just as important as the main characters.  I also now know everything there is to know about AMA Supercross thanks to this book.  The beginning chapter blurbs were tied in to the theme nicely.","tifmich6 ""tifmich6"""

Sometimes you wonder how you missed the track changing and then before you know it...your pitched from the bike.""Everything Changes is a book that made me take a step back and think hard about it. I wasn't sure how I was going to rate, so many things worked for me and then again so many things didn't. I rode the fence on this one. I chatted with Kim and we pondered for a while, bouncing thoughts off each other. Both pointing out different aspects of the story and defending why we felt the way we did. To me this is what reading is about. Everything Changes made me feel, made me remember why I am so addicted to words that run across the pages. Reading is an escape for me, takes me away from the real world. I lost my focus and it was no longer that escape, it was more like a job. Shey Stahl is amazing with her dialogue and her descriptions. My first foray into her world was fascinating, and she has made me a fan. I know Everything Changes has some mixed reviews, I have read them. Even before, I started Parker and Ro's journey. I can totally see all the different valid points and even agree with many, but for me this story just worked. I felt while it was very real for two 17 year olds; it was also very frustrating to read at times. Especially as they began to age and still couldn't get their issues on the same page. My nerves were rubbed raw and on many occasions, I wanted to stop and move on. Put the book to the side and go back later. Nevertheless, I am hooked; hook line and sinker. I needed this story. I needed to feel something other than boredom. Shey Stahl did that. She gave me the kick in the butt I needed to focus on more than when the book would end.""We felt so comfortable around each other that we didn't need to say anything. But sometime words would have been nice.""Parker and Ro, I don't even know where to begin. If any two people could screw it up, it was these two. Every fricken chance they got, after a while all I could hope for was an ending where they finally get their train wreck of a relationship under control! 75% of the book was spent NOT communicating with their mouths. So many damn complications, so many consequences that could have been avoided over the 5 year span. Why, because while they were comfortable in each others presence, with each others bodies, they were not comfortable with telling the other how they really felt. Park made assumptions, Rowan made assumptions. Anyway, we all know where assumptions get you, right?""Confused and broken, everything had changed. But like I said, it wasn't just one mistake that led us here. It was one after another.""Their relationship takes everyone on a roller coaster ride of frustration and pure love.  The chemistry and interaction intense. They were a couple who didn't always need words to express their wants and desires, but this was their downfall because when they needed it the most they both failed miserably. The love they felt towards each other was expressed through words on many occasions, but I don't think either actually stopped and acknowledged what the meaning really meant. Neither Parker nor Ro stopped to let it settle in, if they had taken that brief moment maybe there would have been a different outcome. Parker and Ro had years of not getting their crap together, so many chances to give not only each other, but themselves what they truly needed. It was far from perfect, but their moments together when they were just being ""them,"" those were perfect. I rooted for THAT couple. Those moments defined them; those moments are what caused them to cling desperately to each other so it was especially hard to watch as they screwed it up time and time again. While they may not have been able to discuss their relationship, Shey had no trouble portraying the love, the anguish of not being together, the want, the passion. All of this flowed beautifully off the pages, it was raw and gritty. She didn't tell you, she showed you. You felt each emotion as though you were in front of them personally. This book leaves you feeling one way or another. Whether it frustrated you, left you feeling dissatisfied or you really loved it. You FELT, to me that is the sign of a well written story.""I only hoped we didn't destroy each other in the process. How could you tell your heart not to love someone? It was almost like I had to be bitched slapped to fight for myself in this and fight. His words and his truth bitch slapped me and damned if my cheek didn't sting.""There were many moments when I wanted to smack Ro; damn I wanted to smack her so hard. I teared up when she ripped out Parker's heart. On more than one occasion I couldn't grasp why she made the decisions she did. My heart was often in my stomach. Ro is a heroine everyone will love to hate. I won't lie and say she wasn't selfish because she was. Especially towards the end, but in all honesty Parker wasn't all-innocent.  No matter how much I wanted to believe he was. I wanted to blame Ro for everything; she made herself an easy target giving you plenty of reasons to hate her. Yes, there were times I HATED her, but in the same sense, I got her. It's not always easy to love. Parker was just as much to blame, just in a different sense. In the beginning, he could have done so many things differently. So while she was majorly to blame in the end, Parker played his part too.  One thing I had to constantly remind myself about was age and maturity. Yes, they were 21 at the critical part of the story, BUT they weren't always 21. They started out at 17. Parker and Ro became everything to each other. They experienced all their firsts with each other (let me take a second to thank Shey for keep this real). Neither had great role models to base their relationship on, nor had either been with anyone else. Our hero and heroine handled adult emotions with childlike minds and behavior.""...you'd see that while you broke his, he broke yours just as much.""Therefore, from my review you see this story was frustrating and it was flawed; other reviewers are right. However, that is what made it work in my humble opinion. Above are just some of the many reasons I fell in love with Parker's journey. The ending was perfection all in its self. Left me wanting more of the adult Parker. I loved watching him blossom and grow up; his character development was amazing.  His shy quiet demeanor is what drew me to him, I lived for the moments we got to see ""fun quirky"" Parker. The boy only Ro got to see. I know Shey tied this story up, but I became captivated by ""grown"" Parker and it makes me yearn for more of him.I decided to go with 5 stars because no matter how frustrating Ro got, or how unrealistic it seemed that two adults wouldn't have sex once in a 4 year relationship I couldn't pull myself away from their world. I was captivated by their love for each other. I felt strongly for the first time in weeks. I enjoyed the world of motocross. I adored Justin and Addy. The ending as I said was perfection. Not to mention I really enjoyed Shey's writing style. Her mixture of past, present and future piqued my interest and flowed seamlessly. Although, my favorite parts were when she gave us Parker's pov. Reading his thoughts changed the intensity and the meaning of their journey for me.Thank you to Shey Stahl for providing me the ARC of Everything Changes for my honest opinion.",T. Zautner

It's tiring and depressing. It's also hopeful and emotional. This book shows that no matter how bad it gets, you can always find someone that will fit into your life and that you can always hold hope for a future.My favorite character has to be Blue. He is so lovable and energetic. He brightens up the whole story. I also really got into the characters of Kat and Dylan. They were so believable and I found myself hoping that they would team up and stay together until the end. I enjoyed their chemistry and was wondering if they would ever acknowledge their growing feelings for each other.The only thing I did not like about this book was the ending. It kind of left me hanging. I want to know what happens next so badly! I hope that maybe the author will write a follow up to this one. That would be wonderful! There is so much more that could be written about this plague ridden world and the people that are trying to survive in it.I recommend this to anyone that loves a great story that is well written with likeable characters.

Not only has she written a book with believable and relate-able characters, but she has also managed to create mildly terrifying post apocalyptic world filled with disaster and freakish villains hell- bent on INFECTING THE ENTIRE HUMAN POPULATION WITH A MAGICAL PLAGUE. Yes, you heard me. MAGIC. PLAGUE. I know that some of you who read disaster books and criticize the lack of science are saying, &#34;Pssht. Not reading this book. Next.&#34; And that's okay. Because as I have so generously pointed out to you... the book has magic in it. But that does not mean that there is no logic at all. As a matter of fact, our main character is very scientific about her methods of avoiding contracting the plague. (Okay, it is called the Pox in the book, but I refer to it as a plague. It sounds darker my way. Hehe.) I will now direct your attention to the book cover. See, a mask! Which means science and the passage of airborne thing-a-ma-doo-hickeys (okay, pathogens. I'm not that slow) is addressed in the book and is not taken lightly. Which brings me to the point of my random &#34;science&#34; tangent. I think that even if you are not a complete fantasy/sci-fi/ paranormal/supernatural freak like myself, *wiggles eyebrows* you can still enjoy the book! :D Unless you are really anal about it, in which case, I just warned you about the magic and you can leave the book to the fantasy geeks. I will admit that the appearance  of the bippity boppity boo aspects threw me off at first, but only for about eight seconds. After those initial few seconds, I was actually MORE excited about reading the book. And read, I did. Four hours and two red, puffy eyes later, I was a very content little bookworm sitting on my couch soaking it all in.Kat was a fantastic character. She didn't annoy me that much, which is great since the entire book is from her perspective. I really liked her because she was so real. She was a California girl (oh, crap. I hope it was California. I am bad with little details like that.) who loved shopping, primping herself, and cherished spa time with her mom. She is not like so many other lead characters we are getting nowadays who never wear make-up or hair product, but who have gorgeous hair. (I get the appeal to write about that, I do. If reading it would make it true, I would never have to buy frizz- ease again.) However, It is extremely refreshing to read about a girl who had to realign her priorities so majorly after the end of the world hit. She had a real struggle as a spoiled rich kid trying to make it on her own in a rough and dying world where the people are desperate and the food is scarce. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about her struggles (Not in a sick way.. I mean.. I just. *sigh* You know what I am trying to say.) and how she overcame them.Dylan was a nice little addition to the story. He brought a little bit of laughter and fun to the seriousness of Kat's character. Their meeting and her eventual acceptance of his companionship was well played out.This one character was a delightful addition to the story. (: And I love that the author thought to include something as important as him in the book. That was very thoughtful on the author's part. *nods* Cute. Very cute.And now.. *drumroll* The villains! As is expected in an end of the world novel, there are both crappy people and wonderful people. And then there are Pestas. O.O Who simultaneously freak me out and intrigue me at the same time. That is all I will say about that. Verdict on villains? *thumbs up* I wanted to punch some in the face and run screaming from others, so, mission accomplished. You, know. If that was your end goal..Crap, this review is long.

While it could have been a normal plague, it was not, the Pestas caused the pox. Dark shrouded figures that spread the deadly mutated form of small pox through touch. Shortly after that, it became airborne, and the government started bombing highly infected cities. With the structure gone, pox everywhere, and people turning on people, it is a very dangerous world to try to survive.Kat barely escaped Los Angeles before it was wiped out by containment bombs. On her own for six months, her only goal is to survive and to try to make it to Washington. When Dylan stumbled upon her, she goes against every instinct not to trust people and allows him to accompany her on her journey to her Uncle&#8217;s house. Dylan having lost everything and everyone is just grateful not to be alone.Before the pox, all Kat cared about was her appearance, morning latte, and her boyfriend. Now she only cares about food, water, and safe shelter away from other people. This has made her tougher, and a survivor. This change is one of the reasons I like her as a character. Instead of just giving up, she pushes forward and fights to live. The biggest reason I liked her as a character is that when everyone else is giving up their humanity for survival, Kat still cares even if she thinks or act like she does not. Dylan has been sheltered from most of the atrocities and he is a bit nave about the way the world is now. With his innocence, he is a great balance for Kat.The World of Ash is a fantastic addition to the post-apocalyptic genre. I enjoyed every moment of the novel, and I am curious to see what Kat and Dylan&#8217;s story holds next. I am also dying for more information about the Pestas, and why the pox started in the first place. I am really hoping for another book to add more to the story. I will defiantly be looking out for another installment.",Chandra Haun

Kat, one of the lucky survivors, trying to get to her last living relative, has decided the best way to stay alive is to stay alone. But that is until she meets Dylan who has no one else to live for. Convincing Kat that it's safer to stay in numbers, they start off on a journey through the barren wasteland to a new life. That's only if they can survive the disease, bands of armed and deadly children, and piles of burning pox-infested bodies.Shauna Granger has written a different post-apocalyptic story and I was surprised at how the story turned out. Kat is also a different heroine in this type of story. She wasn't born and raised for this life. Far from it. As it does say Kat would 'rather drink lattes and read magazines' than be in a fight for survival. This is what I really liked about the story. She is just an average teenager who has really had to learn and adapt to her new environment in order to survive, which is especially hard since she doesn't have anyone to help her out but her own mistakes (which she can learn from) and instincts (which she develops).Granger's writing is beautifully descriptive and she was able to describe all the settings and actions wonderfully, which kept me engrossed in the story. The only part of the story that I found a bit lagging were the beginning chapters where Kat is alone. I just wanted her to do something, but alas nothing much happened. And then two things occurred. Kat met Blue and Dylan, and the story really picked up the pace and held my attention all the way to the end, giving plenty of twists and turns with an ending that has me beginning for the next story.I definitely look forward to the next story from Gardener, and I would recommend World of Ash to anyone who loves post-apocalyptic stories.",Cheree Smith

I find the devastation of a world destroyed or life as we know it being threatened to be of particular interest. Watching characters turn to their most basic instincts and fight to stay alive. Isn't that what makes for a good read? To watch a life decimated only to look up and realize everything is right in the world of reality? Makes people grateful for what they have, and I with Thanksgiving having just past, I was in the mood for a book that made me grateful for an easy existence.World of Ash hits the ground running from the very first sentence. Kat is a young girl who is on her own. Her parents are lost to the disease that has claimed a majority of the world. She only knows of an uncle who lives off the grid and in the safety of his ""hippie"" lifestyle on Washington. She is desperate to get to him and his hydroelectrical oasis of a state. She is forced to face groups of survivors who have decided to take whatever they can from whomever they please without any regard for those people they leave stripped of all their supplies. After one particular incident leaves Kat even more frightened than before, she chooses to avoid people as a whole. That is until Dylan stumbles up to the doorstep of the house she is squatting in.Dylan is desperate for help for his last surviving friend, despite the clear evidence that his friend is already infected. He made his way to a town doctor's house for help and only finds Kat in the physician's place. Soon after he loses his friend to the pox and is left to wonder what to do now. Kat is his lifeline. She is the first person his is confronted with after losing everyone he knows and he clings to her. He begs her to let him come along with her to which she reluctantly agrees.After that moment, Dylan and Kat are in it together. They are a unlikely duo set on reaching Kat's uncle in hopes of finally being safe. But the world is harsh and dangerous and they must trust in each other more than ever. With a budding romance cementing their connection to each other Dylan and Kat are on a trip for salvation that may just be their doom.I had heard superior things about the author Shauna Granger. Her Elemental series is still resting heavily on my TBR and I was anxious to see how her writing was. I was sucked in pretty quickly. There was danger around every corner. I found myself squealing a few times over a few of the close calls Dylan and Kat had in their journey. My heart raced, my brain became scattered with scenerios and how I would handle them myself, and my finger could not dance quickly enough across the screen of my e-reader.I did not know the book was going to leave on a cliffhanger so that was a big disheartening. I saw the percentage on my e-reader growing higher and higher and I knew there wasn't going to be a resolution in the last 3% of the book. I was devastated. I wanted to continue on further. I wanted to see what happened next. Cliffhangers can be the worst... but then there's the joy one can feel with knowing another full-length book is on the horizon.World of Ash will rivet its readers with a tangible fear for the characters in the story and the reality that a world of devastation is not such a far off concept.Review Posted on: [...]",Danielle Schneider

World of Ash is my first book by Shauna Granger, and it definitely won't be my last. Her writing is fantastic, and the world she built is so realistic it's scary. The idea of the Pestas - some sort of monsters who infected and caused the plague that's wiped out most of the population - really freaked me out. The plague is terrifying as it is without monsters spreading it around. It was a nice break from zombies, which if you hear me saying that, then you know this book has to be good.I thought it was different how Kat was living a happy and privileged life before the apocalypse - many times the main character in a post-apocalyptic world possessed skills that would enable her/him to face the hell that has become the world. But in Kat's case, she was living a cushy life before and has no delusions that she didn't have any idea how to survive in the beginning. That's what makes her character so impressive; she's struggled and fought to survive, learning along the way.If I imagined what the world would be like after an apocalypse, this is the kind of world I think it would be. In World of Ash, the government takes action in ways that are so awful, I could feel Kat's emotions coming through the pages. Kat feared other human beings who were healthy as much as she did the plague and the Pestas.Her mother was wise in warning her before she left that she wouldn't be able to trust other people. She finds an exception in Dylan, and I was happy she had companionship and help. I loved Dylan and Kat's relationship - they were partners in this new world, and each carried his/her own weight. They saved each other in so many ways. He's just the kind of guy you'd be lucky to have around in an apocalypse. He was naive at first, thinking the government would help healthy people, but Kat helped him see it's everyone for him or herself.I loved World of Ash from it's front cover all the way through to the back cover. Kat and Dylan are two of my new favorite characters. Please tell me there's going to be a second book - I can't help wanting to find out what happens next!",donniedarkogirl

I could imagine the world becoming what Kat had to endure and persevere though.  These books made me laugh, cry, feel sad and scared, all of the emotions a great story has.

World of Ash can really make you wonder what life would be like after an apocalyptic plague wipes out a large portion of the population. And what the plague/pox doesn't kill, the military certainly will in order to 'protect' and control the situation.This is the situation young Kat finds herself in. Her home, L.A., was recently decimated, her family gone and she is alone on the road, traveling by foot toward Washington. This deadly disease is not only deadly but has a magical element it all. It is spread be these creatures called Pestas. The first scene I read that had one of these Pesta's I was holding my breath right along with Kat! Creepy! Scientists have no cure so Kat feels her best chance is to follow her mother'sMost people she comes across are angry,violent or scared and often Dangerous. Lucky for Kat she does come across two companions during her travels. A dog named and a young man named Dylan. Together they set off. Blue is a sweet, protective dog that is so lovable. Dylan is naive but caring and has some good knowledge about cars that helps. Kat is great one minute and annoying the next. She used to be very materialistic with her fancy nails, spa treatments, $300 hair styles, etc. That lifestyle is so far from mine it can be a bit hard to relate to her at times. But she is tough and has learned a lot from the situation so I also give her a lot of credit where it is due.Biggest disappointment for me was we really don't learn much about the Pesta's. Kat says the are magical. Everyone knows about them. But how they work, where they came from, etc is still very unknown. The magic element simply seems to be they came from nowhere and infect you with the slightest touch. I hope there will be  more info in another book that will answer more about there part in the story and continue Kat's journey.When the next book comes out, I will be quick to buy a copy!",J. Rivera

What had happened to her world to require one? As it turns out, quite a lot.Kat used to spend hours on her hair and sipped lattes at Starbucks. She took her car to get washed once a week, and never let the gas go below half a tank. When her dad wanted the family to go on a camping trip when she was younger, she was mortified by the thought of peeing outside. Now Kat&#8217;s a changed woman: she carries a knife in her boot, is rightfully scared of other people, and has no one left in the world. Her parents both died of the pox, an incurable plague spread by the mysterious Pesta.WORLD OF ASH is set in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world. Most of the humans left alive have banded together in violent groups, happy to rob and even murder lone travelers. The government bombed cities hit hard by the pox, and then holed up on bases. Kat keeps to herself, trusting no one as she journeys on foot from California to Washington. She&#8217;s hoping to find the only family member she may have left. I rather liked the world the author created, and thought the after effects of the pox were realistic.Kat is a character I think a lot of readers can identify with. I love me some Starbucks and modern comforts of life, and I know I&#8217;d be lost if electricity stopped. Kat mourns those things, as well as her family, but she doesn&#8217;t let it stop her. She keeps going, and more important, learns as she goes. Anytime she makes a mistake, she remembers it, and tries to keep from screwing up more in the future.On her journey, Kat meets up with Blue, a starving dog she rescues. Blue was one of my favorite characters, because if the world ended, I&#8217;d want a protective, smart dog like him at my side. She also meets Dylan, a guy in a similar situation to her. Despite being wary of trusting anyone, Kat eventually does come to trust him, and the two fall into an easy companionship. Dylan is a nice guy, and in an unusual twist, Kat is the more prepared and stronger one. She&#8217;s been on the road a lot longer than Dylan, and has seen more than him.I mostly liked WORLD OF ASH. It&#8217;s a well-written book, a solid New Adult Post-Apocalyptic story. The beginning was a bit slow for me, but maybe necessarily so, as the author had to establish the current state of the world and how it got that way. The action picks up once Kat meets Dylan and they really get underway on the trip to Washington. I liked the interactions between them, and even got behind their relationship, probably because it WASN&#8217;T love at first sight, and they had a few bumps along the way. The ending threw me a bit, because after a ton of action, the book just ends. But it is the first in a trilogy, so I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s a lot more in store for Kat and Dylan.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.",Leeanna Chetsko

They spread the pox through touch), the government try their hardest to contain it. Most everyone over the age of thirty have died from it and there is no cure. The government decide to take the extreme measure of bombing all the cities affected to try and stop it from spreading.Kats father is the first to contract the pox and once he brings it home its a given that her mum will have it too. Her mum persuades her to go to her Uncles house in Washington. He is self sufficient and is most likely alive. Kat is the kind of girl that all she ever had to worry about was her hair and makeup. Now though she is thrown into a life that is anything but ordinary.Kat has been walking for hundreds of miles and has thousands still to go. During her travels she has been attacked and beaten and has learned to be wary of everyone. She stumbles across a farmhouse that has its own well and cant believe her luck. While there she finds a dog, Blue, that's malnourished. Luckily the house she is at has tons of food for Blue. She feeds him up and he becomes her friend and protector. She also meets Dylan. He comes to the farmhouse because a doctor used to live there and he hopes the doc can help his friend. He is too late though. Kat is very wary of him and doesn't trust him but she agrees to let him travel with her because he can hotwire a car. What follows next is their journey that's fraught with danger from The Pestas and other survivors!When I first saw the cover of this I knew straight away Id read it. I adore the Dystopian genre and will pretty much try anything. Well I'm so glad I did.Kat is a typical teenage girl and worries only about her looks and her hair. She is thrown into a situation that she has no idea of what to do and now all she worries about is finding food, water, shelter and surviving one more day. She is one tough cookie and I really liked her character. She spends so long alone and I was so happy when Blue and Dylan turn up. You really feel for her and all that's happened.Dylan was another strong character. From the start you can see he is kind, capable and someone you want on your side. He carries his friend all the way to the farmhouse, even though he has the pox, just to see if the doc can help him. He knows Kat is wary of him but tries his best to put her at ease. I loved seeing their friendship blossom.While World Of Ash isn't the most action packed story, there's still a lot happening. We do get some awesome fight scenes and it is edge of your seat in parts.

World of Ash is my type of book and I couldn't wait to dive right in.She did not disappoint with this book. We start out kind of back tracking/flash backing when we meet the main character Kat. Although it doesn't start at the start of the epidemic that seems to wipe out the human race, it flows perfectly and its written very well. It is a different take on the whole end of the world vibe. Pesta are real monster, spreading a deadly pox wiping out human kind. Almost. Those things are just creepy. They do not seem too far fetched, definitely seem like nightmares come to life.Kat is a awesome character. She goes from I guess you could call her a high maintenance girl, to one who is fighting for her life, and she seemed to make that transition very well. You don't see her dwelling on who she used to be to who she is now. She misses certain things, which is a given, but she knows what she needs to do to survive and does it. I love Kat.Dylan, I loved him right away. When Kat and Dylan meet, what happens doesn't surprise me, because of how much Kat has changed, but I like how their relationship develops. The stuff they end up going through together, brings them closer, and it brings you closer to the characters and makes you that much more attached to them. There were some very scary scenes in this book, the beach house scene is one. No thanks, lol.The ending of this book is AWESOME!

Give me dystopian any day.  So there is no doubt that when I saw the opportunity to read World of Ash, that I jumped at the chance.  Thankfully, I was not disappointed.Taking place after a disease, brought on and still being spread by paranormal creatures, has wiped the majority of mankind off the map, this story follows Katarina aka Kat and a stranger who happens upon her, Dylan and their travels from lower California up through northern California.  The entire time they must do what they can to not be captured by other survivors who are bent on destruction, not be infected with the fatal pox, find food, water and shelter on a daily basis and learn to trust one another while building a friendship in a world where things just don&#8217;t seem to exist anymore.The author&#8217;s way with imagery set the tone straight on with the book.  She put you in the thick of the story, made you fully aware of the dangers and what was at risk if the slightest error in judgment was committed.  You saw through Kat&#8217;s eyes, felt her fears, her pain, her desperation and you traveled with her in this new world created from complete and utter destruction on multiple levels.  It&#8217;s not an easy accomplishment what the author did, but she did nearly flawlessly.I would have liked to know more about the Pestas.  With everything going on, there had to be more known about these things that created and spread the disease that would have been provided to the public, in a way to protect themselves, before everything went to complete chaos.  They are touched on a bit through the book, but just not enough to satisfy my interest.The introduction of a four legged friend made the story even that more enjoyable.  Imagine being alone for months and suddenly finding companionship in an animal that needs you just as much as you need them.  There&#8217;s nothing hokey about this storyline and it showed Kat as she really is, a caring person whose future is that of a voyager, taking one day at a time and hoping that in the end she finds what she is looking for.The chemistry between Kat and Dylan was very believable.  She meets up with him when he is at his most vulnerable and gets to know him from there.  In turn, he gets to see her at her weakest and the two become wayward travel companions.  Together they deal with danger, loneliness, learn of each other&#8217;s losses, boost up one another and bounce things off each other without resentment.This book works for any age level that loves this genre.  A solid scifi dystopian without the blood and gore that many think they need, but don&#8217;t and without graphic details that turn some readers off.

6258665,1492902144,5,Absolutely Brilliant!,A1WJAWTQTGFDN6,"[1, 1]","Reviewed at FicCentral.com:I'm not usually one for stories that have anything to do with an apocalypse or its aftermath. They&#8217;re too disturbing, too hopeless, and very often so far-fetched that they border on ridiculous. In fact, I&#8217;m not even sure why I decided to read this one. But there was just something about it&#8230;Kat is alone in an ugly world. An unstoppable plague has swept the earth, and for the few who are left, it&#8217;s every man for himself. What makes this story different is that the plague is not natural, not man-made, and not something the human race could possibly have prepared for. It&#8217;s origins are in magic, dark creatures who roam the countryside with a deadly touch. What was once simply lore is now a bleak reality, and as it becomes obvious that there&#8217;s no stopping its spread, the government is bombing cities in a futile effort to contain it.Kat is portrayed beautifully. Having once lived a rather luxurious life, survival is now her only goal, and while she misses her Starbucks, she doesn&#8217;t waste her time grieving material losses. When the plague took her father, and her mother was only a day or two from death&#8217;s door, Kat struck out on her own at her mother&#8217;s urging, determined to get to Washington. That was where she hoped to find an uncle living off the grid and with the means to take her in.Along the way, she runs into the usual obstacles, other people with their own survival agenda, a government turned against its own people, and of course the constant threat of being found by a Pesta &#8212; the plague bringers. She doesn&#8217;t luck into any gigantic stores of food, a perfect cabin in the middle of nowhere, or some post-apocalyptic Utopia that strips her of all her worries. But she does come across a boy who, like her, is alone and unprepared for their grim reality.Dylan is undeniably handsome and altogether decent in a world that is anything but. She tries to turn her back on him, but he persists, convincing her that traveling together is best for them both, and off they start toward Washington. Along with a dog and whatever vehicle they can hotwire, they head north.The relationship between Kat and Dylan is a subtle climb. They start as unfortunate strangers, begin to depend on each other, and eventually form a very necessary friendship. They fumble their way through decisions and moments of danger, and along with their stray dog Blue, they keep putting one foot in front of the other.  The realistic way in which they&#8217;re portrayed, a little lost yet determined, is something I rarely see in books of this genre.  Of course the line between friends and more begins to blur, but even as they discover their feelings and begin to give in to each other, this is not a romance.  It&#8217;s a tale of survival of two people who rather fortunately just might be right for each other.But...I guess the story had to end at some point, but I was hoping against hope that it wouldn&#8217;t, even when I saw I had only a few pages left.  It pulled me in, made me believe in the characters, and had me staying up all night just to read what would happen next.  But while I hated the realization that I&#8217;d read the very last word of the book, the ending gave me some hope that there might be a sequel.  If not, someone had better fanfic it! [EDIT: The author has confirmed that this is the first of three books, so YAY!!!]The Verdict...Absolutely brilliant.  Buy it &#8230; borrow it &#8230; hell, just get your hands on it and read!  It&#8217;s a great story with believable characters and an incredible way of drawing you in from the very beginning.  It doesn&#8217;t shy away from the ugliness that is every man for himself, but it doesn&#8217;t hit you over the head with unpalatable violence and gratuitous gore.

My second biggest issue was the author's tongue-in-cheek allusions to romance writers' attributes.If you're going to make an argument that romance  writers are real people too, why make the hero tall, dark, dimpled,  handsome and strapping and the make the heroine slight, elegant, with a  body that won't quit and long blonde hair?The characters made some  stupid and annoying decisions that were based on game-playing and  one-upsmanship.  The one thing I really can't get over though is that the  hero bought the heroine's daughter a dog, without any prior warning and  without permission (obviously).  You don't do that to someone, you don't do  that to an animal and you do not do that to a single mother.  Ms.  Thompson had many false starts that she didn't develop as well as she could  have.  It's a pity because those resolutions could have really worked to  bring the couple together, but they kind of faded away.  Otherwise, it was  a mostly pleasant read.  I did have one laugh-out-loud moment.  And when  they finally 'did the deed' I was impressed with our hero's sensitivity.

Sure, it's a light froth of a story, but it's inherently more clever than most similar romances.  Not plodding and not so linear, even if the ending--like all romances--is the predictable one.  Yet in this story, getting there is a whole lot of fun.  I can't remember when I laughed aloud as much reading a story of this genre.  Author Rhonda Thompson gets in her pokes, spoofing the fact that in a romance novel, the hero must be handsome with washboard abs--then giving her hero dazzling looks and washboard abs.  A similar description applies to her heroine, just as Thompson mocks the prototypical heroine's requisite beauty.  Only one part of the premise seems a bit strained, that the hero is a book reviewer for a local paper who has a huge following and enormous influence, a situation that never occurs in real life--sorry, book reviewers just are not household names.  Still, most of these romances require some suspension of credulity.  At least this novel is reality-based, and once a reader accepts the hero's popularity as a motivating force in the story, it's a whole lot of fun to read the tale Ms. Thompson has woven.  If she can sustain this pace, she is going to have an important romance writing career.","HeyJudy ""heyjudy"""

They are tricked into attending an award ceremony together by their respective friend. They are both using aliases and they each assume the other to be a &quot;gigolo&quot; and &quot;hooker&quot; so when the winners are announced - they are astonished at who they are with. The sparks fly as they both accept their awards. They both feel betrayed by their friend. Trey feels the &quot;romance&quot; genre has warped women's ideas of men! His wife divorced him seeking a more dynamic romantic partner - one that appears on the pages of romance novels. He writes another little ditty for his column that offends Katrine regarding the awards dinner. He had to financially compensate Katrine for the prior column he had written and his editor is hoping to avoid another occurrence. The two combatants are lassoed into working together. They are assigned by Trey's boss and her editor to work on a newspaper feature on romance. This involves a month of dating where each will write from their perspective about them. The newspaper will fund all these dates and the publisher is hoping to raise his circulation numbers. Trey goes to great lengths to arrange terrible dates. Katrine must find a positive aspect for each of them and she does!This was a laugh out funny book!!! The dates are hilarious!! The verbal sparring between the Kat and Trey is great!

There are some good, even sexy, parts in the middle but overall this book was ruined by the beginning and the end.When Chapter 1 begins the heroine is already in a brothel. We miss the development of how she got there, the angst of her choices, the horror of falling so low. As a result, we never get to know her well or sympathize much. Also it's hard to understand why she's legally responsible for her father's debts; it doesn't work that way. With such a faulty premise, the plot loses credibility.The hero is a heel. I was holding out for him to realize he loved the heroine and redeem himself. He did neither. When the heroine tells him near the end that he doesn't know how to love, I agreed with her. I never felt he loved her. At the end I wanted him to grovel for her forgiveness for what he put her through.This brings me to my pet hate. Authors and publishers who throw in a menage a trois scene without a warning. If I'd been warned this book contained one, I'd never have bought it (and I will never buy another of this author's). Apart from its mere presence, this scene irritated me by being near the very end of the book, when both hero and heroine should be realizing they love each other. After he's taken all her orifices, the hero just decides to pass her onto another rich ""protector"", offers to find the protector himself, and then volunteers to join them in a menage so the heroine can get used to it. What a selfless guy! He eventually stops the proceedings but only after the stranger's penis is in her anus. Ugh!The heroine was TSTL to accept this situation.

It's a plot which can be told with dozens of interesting variations, and which can make for a satisfying romantic experience.  Perhaps one of the best examples would be one of the original modern romance novels,The Flame and the Flower, by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss.  The epic love story of overbearing Brandon and gentle Heather is still in print more than thirty years later for good reason -- it's well-written, sexy and a gratifying read.However, this novel is just trashy -- it's not even well-written erotica.  It's just embarrassingly horrible.  The author has no grasp of dramatic tension and her dialogue is laughably wooden.The characterizations of her hero and heroine are equally ham-handed.  The hero, Sebastian, never convincingly embraces his ""love"" for the heroine, even at the end when he finally produces a marriage proposal.  We know why he initially refuses to love the heroine -- he's avenging the death of his mother at the hands of the heroine's heartless father.  But I was so convinced of his continued loathing for her that I could not buy into the last three pages when he declares his love for her and falls to his knees, sobbing.  As late as the chapter before the epilogue, he actually starts to have sex with his ""lady love"" with another man, in a yucky threesome right out of some shot-on-video porn movie.And just who is the heroine?  Other than learning that Sarah Winslow is an eighteen-year old penniless former rich girl, we don't know her at all.  She has no backstory, so the reader has no reason to care about her.  For some unexplained reason, she is suddenly content with being the increasingly ill-used sex slave of this mean-spirited ""master,"" to the point where she ""falls in love"" with him.  The author tries to convince the reader that this masochistic display on the part of Sarah is a way of soothing Sebastian's broken spirit and winning his love, but it never comes across as believable.I finished this novel so that I could write a proper review, but that review can really be summed up in one word -- UGH!  If you want classy erotica, try Anais Nin'sDelta of VenusorStory of Oby Pauline Reage.  If you want a hero who starts out mean-spirited and redeems himself, try one of Johanna Lindsey's early works, or perhapsWhitney, My Loveby Judith McNaught.

Check outSweet Persuasionby Maya Banks.  It has a strong story line and strong characters, and is extremely sexy.

However I felt like the author switched heroes in the last few chapters of this novel which really ruined a lovely romance.Heroine Sarah Winslow is about to lose her virginity in a brothel.  She is deeply indebted to the owner who helped finance her father's debts when he was ailing, now she has nothing to sell but herself.  Unbeknownst to her, the brothel's silent partner is the one behind her entire demise.  Sebastian (Seb) hated Sarah's father and through his machinations Sarah is destitute.Seb takes Sarah as his mistress and Sarah realizes that being his courtesan is better than having to work her debt off in the brothel.  Sarah is an avid gardener and she is taken back to the estate she and her father owned but is now owned by Seb.  She lives in the gardener's cottage, and acts really much more as a gardener rather than a mistress and falls in love with Seb.Seb likes Sarah, who is much more than a snobbish prig he initially believed her to be.  They have a romance that moves along cautiously as Seb distances himself from her for fear of developing strong feelings.  When they do come together it is explosive and passionate.To push her away Seb engages in some hurtful behavior, which I hardly credit to a real hero.  The last chapters especially feel like Seb transforms into an unfeeling brute.  I thought his actions were nigh unforgivable.  What was most shocking was he knew he was in love with Sarah and still acted deplorably.  If he had kept his thoughtful personality throughout the novel this would have rated as four star romance but because he treated Sarah as less than his equal it gets only two.",Melissa

When the loan comes due, Sarah is unable to pay. As the terms of the loan were vague, Sarah is horrified to learn that she must repay the full amount of the loan by working in a brothel, as a prostitute. Unbeknownst to Sarah, her fall from society miss to courtesan was planned by the brothel owner, Sebastian Turner.Sebastian has hated the Winslows for eighteen years because of his mother's abandonment, scheming to ruin Sarah's father Michael, and to own all of Winsolw's property, including the enticingly innocent Sarah herself. Something Sebastian has now accomplished. Owning Sarah, making claim to her virginity, Sebastian has all he ever thought he wanted. But he finds that having Sarah for his personal sex slave is not enough. Can Sebastian put aside his plans for revenge and let himself love Sarah as she deserves?Why can't all historicals be this delicious?! Bondage, domination, and intensely erotic sex make this historical romance unique. Wonderfully so! I'm afraid Louisa Trent's Courtesan has ruined me. How will I ever again read a vanilla historical without picturing beautiful golden bondage bracelets?The characters are wonderfully drawn, the plot well-written, but what makes this book outstanding is it's intensity. I shivered. I bit my lip. I clenched my fist. I wanted. I love it when a book does that to me.

6759233,1596323892,2,I have to agree. . .,A2UQK0FPY9HE1L,"[3, 5]","I have to agree with some of the other lower rating reviews for this book. We really didn't get a back story for Sarah. Why is she responsible for her father's debts?  Maybe a son would be, or someone inheriting an estate and title would be, but alas that is not the case. This was set in the late 1800's though so maybe their laws were different, but somehow I don't think so.  Given the fact that society viewed upclass women as basically just someone to set in the parlor and decorate your home!  I'm sure she could have found some alternative to this!  Why would she even trust a so called friend of her father's given what was said and even acknowledged by her, about her father.  Too many loose ends there.Besides if Sebastian had actually known his enemy he would have known all the faults of his enemy and how he really didn't have such high regard for his daughter let alone anyone else.  So ruining her wouldn't appear to affect him much anyway.  Probably would have been more believable if her father sold her to the brothel!!How can he assign blame to an innocent 18 year old from the time of her birth?  Why didn't he lay any blame at his mother's door?  She chose to give herself to Michael Winslow.  She chose that realtionship was she really TSTL that she couldn't see how that was going to turn out?  So instead Sebastian blames Michael for his mother's choices instead of admitting that she needs to own her choices and perhaps she did.  We don't really know.  He claims that because she was a prostitute she got consumption and died.  So what does he plan for the innocent virgin?  Prostitution and then what consumption and death????  Sounds like it.He constantly belittles her by calling her a wh***.  As she pretty much calls herself and she lets him do all of these things to her.  Never once looking for an alternative.  He ruined her!  He set out to systematically ruin her financially, physically and spiritually.  How can she say she loves him?  Stockholm syndrome??She goes around referring to Sebastian as her owner???  She really doesn't have any pride that she would just let herself be owned like that.  I can't hardly believe that.  It started to get annoying too!Would have been nice if she walked away from him and we read about all the groveling and pain that he went through instead of the quick few pages.  We had to suffer through all the other degradation why couldn't we be rewarded with some true repentance on his part?????","Vanessa ""dreamer"""

I hate to say, I originally requested it because I was just mainly looking for something new to read, but once I got engrossed in it I found it really hard to put down. Drake Devilin is a deeply complex character that keeps you guessing almost the entire story. Sienna Caldwell is never quite what she appears to be on the surface. With the two together the reader is constantly wondering what's going to happen next. Maddie, the little vixen, is one of my favorite characters. She had moments in the story that literally made me laugh out loud. The supporting characters of this story help drive the plot along in ways I didn't think they could. There are a lot of characters in this story, and usually there are too many side plots going on with those characters that a lot of books become confusing. In this story however it really worked. Over all I really enjoyed the complexity of the characters and they enter acted with each other. While this isn't a super quick read if you have the same reaction to it that I did the average reader can finish it within a day or so.Kayla",Bitten by Romance

In the aftermath of WWI, a war hero and an seductive heiress are brought together and married under the banner of convenience. Captain Drake Devilin fought with honor and survived only to return home to find his fortunes under dire circumstances. Enter his grandfather with a solution; marry and protect the old man's best friend for one year and he will be able to restore his fortune.Sienna Caldwell wants to trust her father's decision to marry her to the charming rich boy, but realizes that the world may not be ready for them.

Together, Drake and Sienna battle a magical world of myth and horror before, soon Drake realizes the woman he married is more powerful than he imagined as he fights for her soul and their lives against an unimaginable evil.The Good:This is a really dynamic read. The world, the characters, the story are so much bigger than this book can hold. I felt like this was a really cool movie that was playing in my imagination and I was excited to see how the author would be able to wrangle these large characters into a cohesive ending. Kudos to Mrs Carlton on achieving a very different book in this genre of interracial romance. These are such big  world when sometimes I feel that the romance genre can have such small worlds with limited storytelling. I also like the fantasy of the storyline, it felt a tad steampunk or something along those elements, because of the characters, the forward thinking and the element of advanced science as well. (This is not a steampunk story, there are no dirigibles or cool gadgets). The punctuation was good as well.Favorite scene: pg 144 ""A swirl of familiar faces of his past whirled by him as his stomached lurched in protest. It reminded Drake vaguely of the merry go round at the state fair, but this ride was one of pain.'(I am aware of the error of the scene, see my notes below)The Bad:I had a problem with some things about this novel, most of them were grammar, but they could be resolved with good editing or a Beta reader. I also had a few questions that gnawed on my mind.1. I didn't feel that Sienna and Drake had any chemistry. Why did she love Drake? She spent most of the book running from him or trying to make him a better person by pushing his buttons and playing with his mind. And why did Drake like her other than for her beauty and money?2. The book had a tense, plural, and wrong word usage problem. I would really be into the story, then all of the sudden I would be taken out of the world that was painstakingly created only to roll my eyes at the misuse of tense.pg.49 ""He seem to take her in for a moment before he...."" The word should have been 'seemed'pg. 61 ""Murphy huge frame could barely fit in the tiny chair..."" It should have been 'Murphy's'Page 72 ""Drake carried her passed the huge oak bed"" 'past'Lightening. OMW (Oh my word!) The word ""lighting"" was used instead of ""lightening"" all of over this book and it got on my last nerve3. Sienna and Drake consummating their marriage. I was offended, AGAIN,  women love to write romances that involve near rapes. I call them ""rapey."" Why is this sexy? I am a victim of violence, trust me nothing about this situation in real life is hot.4. Weird descriptions or metaphors. ""Miles dabbed the sweat form his brow as crew followed the path: his dark skin didn't provide an ounce of shade from this heat.a. Where did this come from? Shade and heat are two different matters, and why would your skin color be cooler?5. I felt like the characters knew more about what was going on than I did. If I'm reading fro the narrators POV than I have the benefit of reading everyone's mind. in this case their were too many mysteries regarding the characters motivations and backgrounds and the magic surrounding them. And there were a few random characters as well. Xavier Jacks? Who and What is the point of this character?6. I cannot confirm, but I believe that this author is an American writing English characters. Dear writers, if your are going to write a character that is not the same nationality as you than you have TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH. A lot. This is not the first time that I complained about this, I said the same thing when I read 50 shades. I knew that the author was not an American, because she missed a lot of common language that we use here (we say cabinet not cupboards). In this case is the reverse; while I have never been to England I have watched a lot of British television on PBS and I have read an insane amount of British authors, so I know a little bit about England. For example:On pg. 171 ""adept at a medieval sword fight, he hurriedly..."" This is called fencing. An uppercrust half-englishman may have spent some time learning to fence, it is par for the course. Even if he didn't learn to fence, he would know the proper name for it because he is rich and had a good education.Also, Jo see's Sienna as a slave, but this is set in 1933 and England abolished slavery on its shores in 1774 and then extended that ban to its colonies in 1833; so the character Jo would have no recollection or experience of slavery.7, the 'N' word, which was used five times too many times for my taste is American term that we taught the rest of the world to use (yay us!), but its casual usage I thought was misplaced.","BookDevour ""M2M"""

I have to say I do have favorites, even though all of the characters were amazingly written I found that Sienna and Maddie drew me most. It's not the fact that they were main characters, but their growth in both their actual character and in love.The story was a bit of a slow start and to be able to fully understand what was going on you had to wait to read though at least half way. At times the character switches were not smoothly transitioned or noted to us (the reader) and it made it slightly difficult to keep track of the who. But once it picked up it was magical, action packed and sensual. Sienna was one female character many looked up to and I also looked up to her. She was very wise, caring, beautiful and a force to be reckoned with that many envied (and despised). I was left with some unanswered questions from things (and people) left lingering and were not brought up again. Does this mean a possible book 2 in the future?Anyone looking for a paranormal read with a different approach will enjoy this read :)One scene in the book comes off to be a forced sex scene that some may see as rape.

At times it almost felt like there was too much going on, but Carlton managed to create a story that kept me entertained and left me wanting more.Drake and his men were experimented on during the war which left them as werewolves.  With the war over, they now use their abilities to reap vengeance on those deemed criminals by the government.  Drake sees himself as someone who will never find love until the day he meets Sienna, a woman with secrets of her own.  I was intrigued by Drake and his crew's abilities and wished I could've learned more about the program and their after-war missions.  I felt that there were a lot of loose ends where this was concerned and it left me disappointed.  I wish we'd seen more emotions from Drake as well.  I never felt a connection to him as he seemed to bottle up his emotions.  He was definitely sexy though and someone who could protect the girl no matter what.Sienna also has unique abilities which emerged when least expected.  I also liked that she was colored since too many books don't want to address this issue and the racism associated with it.  This book did touch on the racism, a character close to the hero surprisingly as well as others, and I applaud this author for doing so.  Sienna was mysterious and exotic and this is what drew Drake to her.  Yes, the fact that she was rich was nice but ultimately didn't matter to him.Drake and Sienna had a rocky relationship.  They had a strong sexual connection and their sexual interludes were steamy, and at times animalistic, but they were always fighting against each other.  I never really felt they were in love, but I was very intrigued by their relationship and wanted them to stay together.The best part of the story were the secondary characters.  Grey and Maddie were complex and rough around the edges and I really wanted to know everything I could about them.  The small glimpses of their earlier lives were tantalizing but not near enough information.  I would be thrilled to see books devoted to just them as I thought their characters left a lasting impression through their outspokenness and many layers of emotions and issues.  While these two were my favorites, there are others who I enjoyed and would also love reading more about.While I had some issues with the primary characters, it was the secondary characters that kept me turning the pages as well as the pulse pounding action sequences.  The scenery was written in such a way as to draw you in and added to the eroticism of the story and characters.  There were many strings left hanging to easily bring forth a sequel which I truly hope happens.

Alison Holt also went to a less predictable form of abuse than most female authors do when approaching this kind of topic. When Jesse first wanders onto Morgan and Ryland's farm she is an angry and wounded animal.

The characters (Morgan, Ryland and Jesse) were believable and felt real.There was a part of the story that I wasn't expecting and that was the lesbianism.  I hesitate to mention this because a lot of people will not read a book if same-sex couples are depicted.  While I may not agree with the same-sex couple lifestyle, I am in no place to judge anyone.  I say that so I can mention that while this story has a same-sex couple as two of the main characters, that does not take away from the effectiveness of this story.As a matter of fact, I applaud Alison for writing a non-erotic book that includes a same-sex couple.  While there are those of us that may not agree with this lifestyle, I believe that more and more genres of books will include same-sex couples.  This is just the beginning.

And when I did finish, it made me feel sad for Olga, who was so innocent that she didn't understand that she had no need to feel shame over her rape and the subsequent birth of an illegitimate daughter; sad that I know women who are still looked down upon for these same events in their lives; yet happy for the author/daughter who finally found closure with her missing family.Olga's story of rape and the subsequent pregnancy is one that happens to many women, of many colors, during the course of war. American servicemen are noted for leaving behind unwanted children of mixed blood who are often despised by others from both races. Her strength was in her desire to keep her child and raise her with the best that she could give her; her weakness was in her inability to overcome the shame that kept her from reaching out to a family that she obviously loved and missed, thus denying her daughter the joy of knowing those family members while growing up. But, the reader must remember that Olga was a product of her time, her religion, and was adrift in a foreign country where there was only token support for women in her position.The use of a diary form of narrative, whether real or constructed by the author, was an excellent vehicle for telling this story. It gave us the necessary background to see why Olga made the choices she made and how her upbringing shaped her mindset that made her run from the family love and support she needed. Issues of education, poverty, sexual exploitation, race, and gender bias are all examined in the context of that era. Unfortunately, the reader is left with a sense that when those parameters are applied to women today, they are still in existence. I wholeheartedly recommend this for reading and discussion!",C. F.

I did not expect to enjoy the book as much as I did. As it was, I could hardly put it down and finished it in a day.Several themes are discussed in the book, including the fascinating history of Jamaica, that I knew nothing of and found very interesting. The class system of whites, coloreds and blacks really opened my eyes to prejudice world-wide.Olga Browney's family history is documented. Her white mother, from England, married a black man from Jamaica and was disowned by her parents, and for all intents and purposes, her sister, as well. They had eleven children with Olga being the third youngest, born in 1915. The family was wealthy by Jamaican standards.In 1939, Olga goes to England to stay with her aunt, planning to stay for six months. When World War II erupts in Great Britain, her plans change and she enrolls in nursing school. An unexpected pregnancy forces her to abandon her nursing career. After baby Marie is born, Olga holds a series of jobs to support herself and her child. Olga refuses to tell her family in Jamaica about the baby and the circumstances of her birth, even when she is desperate for money.This story is tragic not only in the events that occur, but because it is true. Olga's courage and tenacity are admirable. I wish I could have met her.",Esmeowl12

That second look endeared the cover to me.  I like to think the old photographs and color drawings on the cover are personal mementos from the author's, now gone, family members ... only the author knows for sure if they are.PlotThe back cover states this book is written in the form of diary entries and old letters ... I would rather like to believe these chapters are reprints of actual diary entries and old letters.Becky travels to Jamaica to visit her sister, Lucy, and decides she does not want to return to London.  During her visit, she falls in love with a man ... the result of which causes them to be the gossip of Jamaica.  They marry and have eleven children, Olga being one of them.Years later, Olga travels to London because she wishes to attend dance school.  Due to a series of unfortunate events, Olga is unable to return to Jamaica when originally planned and decides to attend nursing school.  Sadly, naive Olga becomes a victim and now feels she can no longer communicate or visit her family in Jamaica.  She feels her secret is so huge and unforgiving that she becomes reclusive and takes whatever menial jobs she can to earn wages.Eventually, the truth comes out and the Browney family is reunited.  The sad part is that some of Olga's family died believing Olga to be dead years before, thanks to one particularly cruel, and I believe jealous, member of the family.Main CharactersBecky - I love Becky.  She had spunk, tenacity and didn't give one whit what society thought of her or her actions.  I understand Becky because I was in her place not too long ago.  I applaud Becky and will forever be proud of her and what she stood for.Sydney - The eldest son of Becky - He had to become the man of the house after Becky kicked her husband out of the home.  Sydney was sometimes cruel to the other ten children, but thought he did his best by them when he could.Martha - A spiteful, bitter, jealous, hypocrite of a lady - She was Becky and Lucy's sister who lived in London earning wages as a seamstress for a theater.Olga - Naive, stubborn, proud, untrusting, self-depreciating ... These are a few adjectives that describe Olga.  She was a complex mixture of strong and weak.  It felt as though she struggled with wanting to be taken care of and being proud of the small accomplishments she made in providing for herself and her daughter.OverallI have a strong desire to learn my own ancestry, so knowing the author researched her family history and based this book on that history intrigued me.  I would have loved to have gotten to know Becky and Olga.

It's told through diary entries, letters, and telegrams by various members of the Browney (Brown) family between England and Jamaica.I thought this was a really remarkable tale, especially knowing it was based on a true story. Olga had to overcome so many obstacles, and such adversity and prejudice. She was independent and courageous, a real fighter. She learned that life's lessons are often difficult and painful, but she carried on and did what she had to do.I learned a lot of really interesting things about life in Jamaica, as well as life in England during World War II. It was such an eye-opener to discover how different classes and different races were treated, and how they were perceived. But at the same time, it was inspiring to see how so many people rose above it all, carried on, and lived happy lives.I wish the diary entries and letters had been dated, because I often found myself wondering when a certain event was taking place, and how long it had been since something else happened. There were also times when I had to think for a minute when the perspectives of the letters or diary entries changed, but it was also really nice to get different people's perspectives and learn the story from different sources.Olga - A Daughter's Tale is a fascinating trip through time. I always enjoy hearing family histories, and this was no exception. This story is interesting, heartbreaking, inspirational, and real.",Marie @ Ramblings of a Daydreamer (book blog)

But world events, personal tragedy and malicious intent all combined to prevent her from returning to her family in Kingston.Based on a true story and written using diary entries and letters 'Olga-A Daughter's Tale' is about cruelty, revenge and jealousy inflicted on an innocent young woman and about her moral courage, dignity, resilience and in particular love.'  from the author's descriptionI loved this book! I started it late in the afternoon and couldn't put it down until I finished and was left wanting more!This is a story of how one persons selfish cruelty changed the course of a beautiful young woman's life foreverI enjoyed the history of Jamaica, which I knew nothing about. The sketches of the plants and birds of the region, the descriptions of the plantations and towns made you feel like you where there.The courage of Olga's mother, Becky, to buck societies 'rules' and go with her heart even though it cost her dearly was an inspiration.Then there's Olga...gentle, loving, trusting Olga. One brief instant in time and her life was forever changed. My heart hurt for her and the unjustified shame she carried all those years. But, she never let it change who she was, never became bitter or hateful. Her sweetness and faith in God was amazing considering. I liked Olga, I found myself rooting for her and railing against the evil selfishness that came against her.I liked the diary form of the book but would have liked to have had dates with each entry to help me keep the timeline better in my head as I read. And I am dying to know the 'rest' of Olga's story now...What happened after she left the Langfords? Did life get easier for her? Did she ever have someone to love her and share her life with? Did she get to see her remaining family in Jamaica after they found her? There is still so much to tell.Olga is one of those characters that will be in my thoughts for quite a while. Well done Marie!

Moving Target wasn't my favourite story (the cruise ship stuff was over the top as I recall) but references to that story are made in this one, which doesn't make sense. Having said that Missy keeps re-releasing her books and changing them without checking to ensure the details match up, so it's to be expected I guess.Missy's stories are always over-written, and linger too long on the tech aspects but this one takes the cake.

I'm not even American but that conceit really annoys me.Also, Dar and Kerry are really only interesting when they inhabit the same space, keeping them apart for three hundred pages (and filling those pages with boring tech stuff) did not make this an enjoyable read.

There is an element of suspense, indirect commentary on the shallow world of big business and media manipulation, and the book is generally written very well.  However, besides Nic and Aidan, there are really only two other characters that are developed to any extent, which kind of telegraphs the identity of the mystery hacker.

His silence, his privacy, and the fact that the unbearably dashing Nic has been unable to get to know him all combine to give him Aiden air of quiet mystery. I couldn't wait to see the unveiling of his character. (See cons below also)- The development of details pertaining to the men's job is well done. London obviously knows quite a bit about programming or did a lot of research.- The sex scenes are rough and passionate and intense. These two men don't do anything halfway, whether it's working or arguing or tumbling in the hay.CONS:- The two main characters are constantly fighting. Even when they have the occasional tender moment, it's almost always ruined shortly thereafter by an exchange of insults or (what seemed to me like) contrived accusations. Even during the final makeup scene, they're arguing as they seduce each other. Aiden, especially, irritated me: he's angry 70 percent of the time. The other 30 he's just being sullen.- The POV here is third person omniscient, which means that you get a look at the thoughts of multiple people within each scene. Yes, this is a valid point of view for storytelling. I just don't like it. It makes it difficult to discern whether what you're reading is Character A's thought or Character B's *perception* of Character A.- I don't like reading sex scenes that involve one of the main characters with someone who's not the other main character. That happens twice here. I'm not suggesting that the scenes don't serve a purpose; I just didn't understand why those scenes couldn't have been simply mentioned in passing rather than described in a fair amount of detail.Overall comments: The title here is apt--there are definitely sparks between these two. They're at each other's throats right from the beginning of the story, and they never let up. The downside for me was that I WANTED them to let up. Just a bit. Now and then.

Infact you see two young men, one slightly younger and handsome than the other. Nic Gerrard is a 23 years old financial guru. Two years before, barely out of college, he launched a dating company based on a matching program he developed with the help of another young programmer, Aidan West. Fame and fortune smile to Nic, and now he is the man of the day, the most sought bachelor. And in the past he was happy to oblige all the fans around him, dispensing sexual favors like a king waves to his people. Actually Nic is not a bad guy, he simple seems unable to say no. Employees, former fiancees (both male than female), friends... if they ask for a night of sex, Nic is willing to give it to them. Probably it was a preservation instinct, having lost his mother very soon, and never known his father, Nic learned not to develop deep feeling for people, since they can easily go away. Something he experimented also with one of his lover, an older man who helped him at first when he was alone, but that then, without much worries, chose to leave for newer shores.Even his first working relationship with Aidan was taken on in the same way; they worked well together, maybe they could have something more, but when the work was done, Nic practically filed Aidan in a hidden portion of his brain, like a good memory. Not that Aidan was not around, simply Nic moved on toward another goal.On the other hand, Aidan is not at ease with relationships and similar stuff. He had a very bad experience with a former lover, and he no more trust himself to be a good judge around feeling. So probably he was glad that Nic didn't try to deepen their relationship beyond work. But now Nic seems to have changed his mind, and he is till more present in Aidan's life. He doesn't accept a ""no"" as answer, and Aidan is ever more in trouble to maintain his control around the handsome man.Trying to solve an hacker attach to their matching program and also develop a new feature, Nic and Aidan spend a lot of time together. Nic has the chance to see that he is no more interested in the no string attach encounters as before and Aidan can see a new side of the man, a side that makes him believe, and hope, that he will not be only another conquest, a new toy to play and put aside soon after.The undercurrent hacker mystery is also a good one: I hadn't found the culprit, I had two suspects, and no one was the right!",Elisa

Not that I have anything against good sex scenes -  quite the opposite. But in this book, there was no real love and passion between the characters. Nothing but lust. I never warmed up to this disgusting Darcy - a man who frequents prostitues IN MODERN TIMES is not a hero I want to read about. It's completely different in a regency where it was a common practice to visit the courtesans.  Also, I did not like the unrealistic portrayal of Elizabeth.

I thought aspects of this novel were quite clever, but all-in-all I'd say this failed both as a pastiche of Austen's masterwork and as a novel in and of itself.This is the tale of the British billionaire Fitzwilliam Darcy and the woman he meets in Manhattan, his sister Georgiana's mentor, musical prodigy and professor Elizabeth Bennett.  In general I enjoyed the updated personae of P&P; characters (as well as several from other Austen novels, though these are just name-dropped, not fleshed out at all), but a few were rather bizarre; in particular Mrs. Bennett, who is not just an obnoxious busybody here, but a sociopath who offers her daughter up to her boyfriend to be raped!  That, and South American drug dealers and kidnap plots send this novel out of the reach of rational readers, but it is the ""normal"" situations and writing that I found most objectionable, dear reader.  The sex is fairly juvenile, adult in nature but awkward and implausible, as well as sometimes downright obnoxious.  We are told several times that Darcy's trousers tighten uncomfortably when he sees Elizabeth, and there is a running joke about his needing to buy bigger containers of personal lubricant.  Yuk.  We're also treated to not one, not two, but even more masturbatory episodes by both principles, bodily fluids and all.  Again, yuk.  This type of material has been handled by more talented writers, and to greater effect.Another reviewer mentioned the odd footnotes.  Yes.  What a strange choice, dozens of footnotes -- telling us what multiple sclerosis is, Casablanca, a district attorney, a taser, the dimensions of a fencing match area, the Twilight Zone, the Mile High Club -- the oddest assortment of definitions and info, as if it will be read by aliens.  There are also a few text messages written out.  It's a bit of a mess, with no clear image of the audience.  Elizabeth calls Darcy ""Baby"", and she does it way too much.  And the term ""spunky"" is actually used.  ouch.On the positive side, the friendship between Darcy and Elizabeth is nice, and the updates of most characters are clever and interesting.  There seems to be a writer here, buried under awkward and juvenile devices, but where was the editor?  At nearly 400 pages this was a tough slog and I cannot recommend it to those who love Austen.

At first I was quite worried because it cost almost $20, and if I hated it, I would feel like I wasted perfectly good money. I'm glad I went with my gut and tried this book. I just finished it today and I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a modern twist on a classic story.Darcy is a highly intelligent, guarded, closed off sort of guy who's been burned in the past. Elizabeth is a highly intelligent, down to earth, likable character that is guarded due to a past trauma. From the moment these two characters meet, sparks fly! Both are immensely attracted to each other, and Darcy unknowingly insults her two times alone during the first meeting. What I liked about this present day Elizabeth was that she took it all in stride.Darcy and Elizabeth are both guarded when it comes to romantic relationships, he basically uses an escort service (which was the weirdest part of the book in my opinion, lol) and she simply can't get past the first date with any man. As the sparks fly, they decide to be just friends and soon let down their guards and truly connect. They both are feeling the attraction and lust, and still remain friends, BFFs to be exact.*Spoiler Alert* Darcy leaves on a mysterious trip and realizes that he is in love with Elizabeth and must make it home to tell her. She freaks out and acknowledges what she already knows, which is that she is in love with him as well. Once Darcy returns they finally admit their feelings and become a real couple. I love that you build up to this point, and you get to stay with them on their journey as they get engaged, spend their first Christmas together, and battle their fears together.Most books build up to characters falling in love, and then they live happily ever after.... this is great, but I enjoyed seeing what happened after they fell in love.

I loved this story from the very beginning and it has quickly become one of my favorites.Ms. Oakland has brought to life the pride and prejudice of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett in this tell of friendship and love.  While there is an immediate attraction and unexplained spark from their first meeting, Darcy and Elizabeth must first learn to be friends before either can admit the love that is so evident to everyone around them.  One aspect that endured me to this story, unlike many others, is that the story isn't focused on their constant finding fault with each other but more on the friendship of mutual respect and understanding.

He lives a life that any man would dream of, dates models, runs his companies with a firm hand, has everything formulated for success.  Then he meets Elizabeth Bennet, a former child music prodigy, who has reinvented herself to keep her secrets at bay.  She doesn't fall for Darcy's take-charge attitude.  There's an attraction that draws them together, however wary of what that attraction could do to them, they agree that friendship is all they can offer to each other.  Being friends with someone of the opposite sex is unfamiliar territory so they make their own rules as the go along.

Now seven years later, his mistake still haunts him and he lives his life unattached, taking part in meaningless sex with models (only to satisfy his baser needs), and vowing to never love again.  His younger sister, Georgiana, is soon to be attending the prestigious Longbourn School for the Arts in New York City.  Darcy and his cousin, Geoffrey Fitzwilliam, travel to the university, not only to help Georgiana settle in there, but to meet with a Professor Bennet and discuss the possibility of collaborating on a project that will expand music education  opportunities for underprivileged children.  When he meets Professor Elizabeth Bennet, Darcy finds he is immediately attracted to her, but unfortunately in typical Darcy fashion he has already insulted her.Professor Elizabeth Bennet, was a child prodigy in the field of music and now has achieved outstanding accomplishments in several academic areas.  Being a gifted and talented child has prevented her from having a normal childhood, and because she has been too busy with a performing career she does not have a lot of experience in the relationship department.  Even though Elizabeth feels an intense attraction for Fitzwilliam Darcy, she's seen his picture in the tabloids with his arms draped around  scantily-clad models to know that he is not the type of person she has been saving herself for.Darcy and Elizabeth acknowledge their passionate attraction for each other but because of their past experiences and lack of trust for others, they decide that the best thing for them to do is to be friends with each other, nothing more...  (This reminds me of the movie ""When Harry Met Sally,"" Billy Crystal's character believes that men and women can't ever be friends ""because the sex part always gets in the way"").  Despite Billy Crystal's sage advice, Elizabeth and Darcy become the closest and most connected of friends.  They are closer to each other than they are to their friends and family, the tabloids think they are engaged, and their friends are bewildered by their resistance of a more romantic relationship.  How long will it be before one of them breaks down the walls around their heart and let the other in???I was ""excessively diverted"" with this ""Pride and Prejudice"" adaption and read it with a perpetual smile upon my face.  Ruth Phillips Oakland's tale of Elizabeth and Darcy finding friendship and fighting falling in love was filled with clever and entertaining twist.  I laughed out-loud at the witty dialogue, ironic situations, and her use of tabloids' headlines at the beginning of each chapter.  The supporting characters in this novel were delightfully and amusingly portrayed, I enjoyed seeing Charlotte Lucas as a clothing designer and characters like Lydia Bennet, Caroline Bingley, and Lady Catherine were very true to their personalities.  In this novel, Ms. Oakland incorporated the names of characters from other Jane Austen works, such as: Mr. Harville was the name of one of Darcy's bodyguard, Dr. George Knightley was the name of  one of Darcy's friends, and Lucy Steele was the name of a porn star mentioned.  However, I would have loved this aspect of the book more if the author used more than just the characters' name, and made these characters more distinguished and developed.My one small quibble, and the reason I am giving this book 4.5 stars and not 5, is the depiction of a morally bankrupt Mrs. Bennet.  In this adaption, Frannie Bennet was Elizabeth's overtaxing and greedy stage manger, but because of a car accident a few years ago, she has lost the ability to tell right from wrong.  Now she behaves immorally, unscrupulously, and wantonly; Elizabeth has not seen or spoken with her mother in over six years.  I enjoyed the part with Mrs. Bennet being a pushy parent (that is very real in today's society), but sometimes she was a little too vulgar and obscene for my tastes.I recommend ""My BFF"" to anyone who enjoys reading modern adaptions of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and doesn't mind alterations in the plots and characters of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice.""  In addition, I would recommend this book for mature audiences only and for readers who don't mind reading a few love scenes.  I greatly enjoyed this fun and new spin on ""Pride and Prejudice"" and I savored each minute I spent reading it.Austenesque Reviews","Meredith ""Austenesque Reviews"""
7301526,1936009013,2,"Great twist, but left a bad taste in my mouth",AYDDDZ8BR7WVG,"[6, 10]","To truly enjoy Austen re-tellings - especially those with modern settings - requires tremendous bravery on the author's part and complete suspension of disbelief on the reader's. While Ms. Oakland boldly updates ""Pride & Prejudice,"" the vanilla sex is completely undermined by creepy and disproportionately brutal scenes of violence, most of a sexual and/or stalker-y nature. Ew.I *really* wanted to like this version, but between the amateurish footnoting of well-known songs and expressions; bizarre re-imagining of Mrs. Bennet; and ridiculous sub-plot involving intelligence agencies and drug lords, I couldn't give in. [To be sure, I could easily overlook that Tom Cruise was the only American in a movie full of British Nazis.]Also, it's fun to see characters share names from other JA books but not if they're so underdeveloped that I can't tell them apart.Doesn't come close to these much better books, here ranked on the smut spectrum: ""The Trials of the Honorable F. Darcy"" [high], ""Impulse & Initiative: What if Mr. Darcy had set out to win Elizabeth's heart?"" [medium], and Pamela Aiden's delightful ""Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman"" trilogy [low].",Mia Culpa

The drug dealers and kindnapping really need a redo. I'm sorry but this whole part ruined the story for me. It just wasn't believeable. I felt I was reading a bad skit from Saturday Night Live rather than a Pride and Prejudice redo.Also, the footnotes really need to go. If this were a technical manual, I would expect it. I read them and actually felt slightly offended. Does the author think we are so stupid we need explanations about things that most adults already know? Okay, so there were a few trivialities I didn't know, but I do know how to use Wikipedia. 99.9% of them were totally unnecessary.The sex scenes in this story also need work. Too much information on things not needed and not enough on the things that are. I prefer sensual and not masterbation.I could go on and on about the strange re-working of Mrs. Bennet, but I will just say the character is worked way over the top and not at all enjoyable.There were a few very major grammar errors that stood out on the page and screamed. If anything, that got my goat the most. Typos I can handle, but not bad grammar.If the errors are fixed, footnotes tossed, Mrs. Bennet re-written, the whole drug lord business tossed, the sex scenes made more sensual and less childish, then maybe it will work.I hope Ms. Oakland does rework this story, because I think it can be truly a wonderful story; just not the way it is now.","Rachel Anderson ""Even editors read for pleasure"""

Ms Oakland takes her readers on a wonderful ride, filled with fun and laughter and a little bit of pain. Her characters are so real and her dialog is so fun. Liz and Will are such multi-dimensional people with their share of emotional baggage but only through the strength of the friendship they've forged can they finally deal with it all. And through it all that they find a relationship that neither thought they could ever have found. Love, trust and respect.Ms Oakland brings us a great story filled with wonderful characters, exciting circumstances and witty dialog. I can not recommend this story enough.","S. Harrison ""Shklung"""

I found the historical information fascinating, in fact, I feel like I have a new insight and appreciation for the horror and injustice of the Salem witch trials. Going through the gut-wrenching process with Abigail Parker was so powerful it was as if I went through the trials myself.Abigail was a brave, caring and smart heroine, William a chivalrous, loyal and lovable hero. This sweet love story was a nice change from the graphic romance novels I've read recently.With The Summerland, be prepared to be entertained, to be terrified and to fall in love, all while learning about a dark, appalling time in American history.

All the characters are interesting and fully drawn, and the historical setting is accurate and frighteningly real. I really felt what it must have been like to live in the days of the Salem witch trials. I despised the men who were conducting the witch-hunt, especially the one who lusted after Abigail. And I was affected by Abigail's angst after losing the women closest to her and embarking on her journey. The love story was mysterious at first, and sweet afterwards.

How mass hysteria touched such a small town and caused so much grief is so beyond me. I have found very few books that center aroud Salem and the witch trials that really have grabbed me. THIS BOOK GRABBED ME, SHOOK ME and TOUCHED ME DEEP!Elizabeth Cheryl did a lot of research on this book. The historical facts in it are incredible. The scenes are so well written that you can picture how Salem looked in 1694. The characters are so well developed that you picture them there. They become part of you. You can feel what they are feeling.I met Author Elizabeth Cheryl at RT in Chicago on April 12th 2012. I overheard her talking about her book as I was speaking to another author. I had to have him hold so I could speak with Elizabeth. After hearing of the book, I immediately knew I had to have it. Elizabeth signed the book for me and I brought it home. I read it in less than 24 hours.At the end of the book, I did what I call ""the end of the book freak out"" where I go through the pages in a panicked rush trying to find more to read as I am denial of it ending. I cannot even tell you how excited I am to get the next book!I classify this book as Paranormal Historical Fiction and highly suggest reading it if you are a fan of witchcraft, the unjustice of the Salem Witch trials, incredible writing and an even more beautiful story!
