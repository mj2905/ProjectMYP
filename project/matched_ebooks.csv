I don't think the Kindle version of WSJ is that much better than other sources of financial news (Financial Times, for example) to justify the price difference.",Dave W
69,B000FDJ0FS,4,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",A36K2N527TXXJN,"[6, 7]","I've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years, but had never really considered subscribing to it. For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.",Dr. Bojan Tunguz

71,B000FDJ0FS,1,Not quite a disaster,A3L25SHGZKH8Q1,"[3, 3]","I read nearly all my books and magazines on Kindle.  I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.  I suppose I'll have to change my email -",John K. Pearson
72,B000FDJ0FS,2,"Kindle Edition is OK, online great, iPhone app is sadly lacking...",AJNIKU4GSIWHY,"[5, 5]","This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.

77,B000FDJ0FS,4,"Excellent and convenient way to read the WSJ, with 1 complaint..",A11I1I9QLMAM1A,"[10, 10]","When it comes to speed and convenience, there is no better way to read the Wall Street Journal. With almost no advertisements, you just get the articles and pictures in a very concise and easy to read format. With wireless delivery, you get the paper delivered to your Kindle, no matter where you are, as soon as it comes out.I can't say enough how much I enjoy this version of the Wall Street Journal. With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the ""Page One"" section of the paper, it has several ""What's News"" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these ""article teaser links"", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.  I highly recommend you get it in this format.  Good luck when you cancel your paper version, though, as they'll keep delivering it to you long after you cancel (so they can keep reporting you as a reader to their advertisers).

359,B000JQUSBQ,5,Great Collection of Fairy Tales,A36K2N527TXXJN,"[3, 4]","Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.",Dr. Bojan Tunguz

361,B000JQUSBQ,4,Delightful stories that are similar to European tales,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,"[42, 45]","There are twenty-nine stories in this collection. These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.",Israel Drazin

Allow me to give you some background: The heroine is married to an abusive husband who has lots of money and runs the town due to his control of the logging business there. She has one great kid and one delinquent and she is beaten down by her hubby and shows more annoyance than concern for her kids who obviously are dealing with their dysfunctioanl family in their own ways but need help. She takes crap from her husband, her kids, and pretty much everyone. The hero works for an environmental agency and sees the man's wife and smiles at her after which they go to infatuation and love.OK, if she is so terrified of her husband and doesn't have the nerve to leave him, where is she getting the nerve to have an affair on him in front of the whole gossiping town (her tramp friend takes her to dinner and they are seen by everyone eatting with the hero and his coworker)? Honestly, I'm not one for infidelity, even if she is cheating on her abusive/cheating husband - LEAVE HIM. I get that he is this controlling powerful guy, but if she is afraid to leave him, what does she think he'll do if she is cheating on him? This was compared to Bridges of Madison County, but it is not anywhere near as good as that - it may be about infidelity, but it does not have the same intensity - it's just not written as well.

Quinton was a great character and I loved the way that he found his way back to his Native American roots and that helped him face his present-day issues. Regina was a very complex character; she still has a little bit of self-worth left and it was struggling to emerge under Quinton's attentions. Wayne was a perfect example of how total power leads to total corruption; he is thoroughly evil. Quinton's great-aunt, Whispering Feather (I loved that name!) was marvelously wise and had a very generous spirit that reached out to encompass Regina as well as Quinton. And let's not forget Quinton's dog, Hurricane and Regina's dog, Fury; they had wonderful personalities, as well.This was a very well-written book although the proofreading could have been done better. The imagery was really wonderful; the graphic descriptions really made the people and events come alive for me. I just wish there had been an epilogue so I wouldn't have been left not knowing what happened to anyone.********spoiler alert******** I was very angry that Regina blamed herself for not fighting back sooner, especially when it was clear that the only reason she was able to prevail against Wayne's violence was because of the two dogs protecting her. I worked with battered women and the most likely time for a woman to be killed is when she confronts her abuser. At the very least, she would have been severely beaten.I still got a lot of pleasure out of reading Indian Moon even with its faults, so I would recommend it to others.",Dafna Yee

Quickly the pair runs into the Templeton family at a restaurant in town.  With just one glance, Quinton knows that Regina, the wife, is the woman of his dreams.  The only problem is that Wayne Templeton owns the logging company that Quinton is working with and the fact that Wayne, with his money and respect, basically owns the town.  Quinton doesn't know how Regina feels about him so he goes about finding out.  They decide to meet for dinner the next night and they both feel an attraction for one another.  So while Regina's husband, Wayne is out of town, she and Quinton carry on a loose affair, trying not to be noticed.  Then trouble begins.  Someone has been vandalizing areas of the mill and someone is setting Quinton up for it.  While avoiding the town cops, Quinton and Regina's relationship intensifies, especially when Quinton learns that Wayne is verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to Regina.  He only wants to take her away from such a horrible husband.The story comes to a peak when the cops come to Quinton's door with evidence that Quinton has done the vandalizing.  Quinton isn't guilty but the problem is that Regina is his alibi.  Needing to work things out in his head, he escapes to the nearby American Indian reservation that Quinton grew up on.  Quinton has been away for a long time but his aunt takes him in and gives counsel as to what he should do about his problems.  He needs to talk to Regina.The closing of the story is where I don't want to give spoilers but the reader finds out who is doing the vandalism when the last act is a huge one.  Quinton doesn't want to lose Regina, he wants to be her white night.  With the cops still thinking he is the perpetrator, he walks right up to the cops and is arresting right away.I don't normally read this kind of romance novel, but it was a freebie on Amazon so I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  There was some depth to the story.  Much more so than the Harelequin Romances of old.  The characters could have been more fleshed out and there were a few typos that need editing, but I did like the story.  I found myself rooting for Quinton and Regina.  It was hard to believe that they weren't caught by someone seeing them out, but they weren't.  I do have to mention that the ending was highly unbelievable and disappointing. But now that I have invested myself into this story, I want a sequel to see if the author can redeem the terrible ending to this story.  I do hope Carolyn McCray writes it so I can find out what happens to Regina and Quinton.  3 stars.","Regina Niesen ""Gina"""

Yet I have intensely mixed feelings about this book; it has the basic elements of a romance novel and it goes way beyond that. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a psychological thriller but if I did, I wouldn't be far off.Regina was married off when she was 16 years old. She has two children and a bully of a husband who she can barely stand. Quinton is an environmentalist hired to do an Environmental Impact Assessment for the logging company owned my Regina's husband.Quinton should be the antithesis of all Regina stands for, with his mixed heritage and his tree-hugging ways, except he's not. Strangely the pair are drawn to each other as Quinton represents a fantasy which has before now, been beyond Regina's reach.In getting to know Regina, Quinton begins to rediscover himself and regains contact with a major part of himself that he'd lost touch with. While all this is going on, life does not stand still.Quinton and his charming assistant, Ralph become implicated in a vandalism case, the townspeople are less than welcoming to the strangers and there's the nearby reservation where Quinton has strained relations, or so he thinks. Not to forget the husband, of course. All in all, there's just so much tension that I couldn't help taking frequent breathers from the book.Generally I can't stand stories that have infidelity in them and that seems to be the main theme in Indian Moon. Forget that Regina was told by the old elder on the reservation that she was not married in her ""heart,"" and the fact that she was also hinted that Wayne, her husband could have maybe broken his vows to her; I'm not sure those are reasons enough to excuse infidelity.One thingIndian Moon: Love Isn't As Far Away As You Think (Real Romance...For the Rest of Us)does is challenge the reader. I certainly found myself shifting uncomfortably as I read and as I found myself being drawn into the lives of Regina and Quinton (and getting to like them to boot); I couldn't help but remember that even though these characters might be fictional, they represented the effects and choices we all take every day.So no, I did not fall in love with Indian Moon; it certainly won't be one of those books I re-read until they fall to pieces (or the Kindle falls to pieces, whichever).

It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love.

Ralph leaves everyone in his wake smiling and feeling good about themselves, from the hostess in the local barbeque joint to the battle-axe receptionist who ends up giggling at the incorrigible young man. Ralph's antics remind Quentin how long it has been since he's felt joy and pride in his life much less caused it in others.Regina is caught in the ugly and dispiriting cycle of an abusive marriage. She stands as if at a distance watching the effects it has on herself and her two children. But she feels helpless to do anything but keep the simmering violence from escalating.When these two lost and dispirited people meet something happens that changes their lives and all of those around them.  They fall in love. But if love doesn't necessarily conquer all, in this case it forces the protagonists to wrestle with deep painful questions.  When did they begin letting others make critical decisions for them? When did they stop being honorable?  Stop asking what was important to them? What they wanted to do and to feel? And when did they begin to believe that nothing they did could make a difference in their lives or in others.This is a thoughtful, challenging story. After al,l it deals with the issues that make can either break or make a person. As Quentin and Regina tentatively explore their feelings for each other they are forced to deal with issues they have caused and ones that they have let happen. They learn that love is worth fighting for. Even more important, they learn that honor, dignity and being true to who they are is the greatest gift they can give to one another and to themselves.",windigo

3473,B001VH6NWU,5,A step by step guide to becoming who you want to be,A2OFPD6JULMHBC,"[0, 0]","Christopher Pinckley has written a step by step guide to becoming who you want to be.  The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be.  This is not as easy as it seems.  So many of us get into the flow of our lives and never really stop to analyze what it is that we want.  This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want.  The second step involves getting rid of the barriers that we all carry as baggage that prevent up from becoming what we dream of becoming and the last step involves getting to where we want to be.The author has been where most of us start.  He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become.  He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals.  Having been there, he can better guide us through these processes.The book is broken down into easy to read chapters and I was surprised at the practical exercises that he gives to make it easy to get from one step to another.  Without these concrete exercises this book might just be another ""go our and realize your dream"" books.  There is much more than that here.This book is a good read for people of all ages even if you think that you have found what you want and are already there.  Looking into our desires is a compelling and interesting exercise, no matter how old or successful we think that we are.","Teresa Mustelier ""WellReadParent"""

It is a very good mystery story line, but for me, it was very dry and boring to read, like eating a bowl of Grapenuts without any milk - not a pleasant experience.  Though the book is action packed, it just seemed very two-dimensional.As I said, I bought two Cliff Black books at the same time, and after I read this book, I wished I hadn't.  HOWEVER, I disliked how this book was written so much, that I immediately read the next Cliff Black book so I could get them both off my kindle, and I LOVED the next one I read (Person's Missing or Dead), and have immediately gone and bought the next Four Corners Mystery.  It's like a completely different author wrote the Four Corner Mysteries, or perhaps a more experienced author.  The Four Corners Mystery is set closer to modern times, they at least have cell phones, (but unfortunately it's dated due to use of zip drives) and the Perfect Crimes story is set back in the 80's if I recall rightly.

It just seemed as though a few of them were a bit redundant and unnecessary.There is some political intrigue in this novel. However, I enjoyed the fact that the author did not harp on it or go into too much detail. That the author chose to focus on the human aspect of it was a refreshing surprise.While it moved a bit slowly at times, overall, this was a fascinating novel of huge scope. The universe created in the pages of this novel is vast and immensely interesting.The ending is edge-of-your seat action. I love the way the author tied up all of the loose ends. It was a very satisfying conclusion.Character Development: 5 StarsThe characters in this novel are extremely well imagined and written. The powerful young man, Senjal, is depicted as a flawed, emotional, gullible teenager. You love him and wish him well, but at the same time you feel that he needs a good spanking (or some discipline, for the anti-corporal punishment crowd).Kendi, another major character, evokes similar feelings in that he needs to become more mature. For a different twist, he is in love with another man who recently rebuffed him.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style of this author is terrific. The sentences are well structured with no choppiness. The dialogue is interesting and realistic. He speaks well in the voices of many types of characters from female to male to child.The descriptions are somewhat overdone in unnecessary places. The action, however, is portrayed succinctly, something I especially enjoy.Editing/Formatting: 2 StarsThere were many editing type errors throughout this work. Mostly they were typographical type things, such as missing words. Having a verb missing from a sentence can be a bit distracting. One error that really stood out was a misspelling of the word `kidnapping'. This word appeared quite frequently throughout the novel, but was spelled `kidnaping' every time.The Kindle formatting was also a big issue. At odd moments, a capital letter would replace a space and another letter. The letter `J' was the most common and it replaced 'space a' often.Rating: R for some language, violence, and prostitution references",Lynn McNamee

I knew from the very first sentence what the ""twist"" in this book was. Though I suppose one can hardly call it a twist, when everybody but the main character knows what happened. Now I'm not sure if it was ever meant to be a twist...Despite wanting to scream in frustration every time she lamented her husband's disappearance, I really enjoyed this book. The book was very well written. There are no big action scenes. There are no epic battles. It's just the story of a woman trying to find out what happened to her husband. Yet I could not set the book down.I loved the world the book is set in. It could easily have taken place in the real world, a few centuries ago. The way the world is set up made me think very much of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell...just not on as grand of a scale.The characters were written well. I never had to stop to figure out why a certain character acted a certain way - everybody was developed enough, and had clear enough personalities, despite not being mentioned for more than a paragraph or two. Even the side characters had clear motivations. It was nice to read a book where everything was put in place for a reason, and all plots get tied up.The only problem I had with this book was the whole Miranda not figuring out what happened bit. For as smart as she was, she really should have caught on sooner...or if not caught on, she should have at least started questioning things. Every time something new got pointed out, I just wanted to scream when she didn't think twice about her observations. But, aside from that, this was a very enjoyable read.[Though I do question that...semi-bestiality? Near the end. After reading descriptions of the change...why?

The story unfolded revealing little clues as we began to perhaps guess what may have caused Alexi's disappearance. Some red herrings and suspicious characters made this a satisfying mystery as well as a fantasy. I enjoyed the fact that Miranda's character as a normal middle aged woman trying to solve a very strange mystery was very believable. In general I found the book was unput-downable!

5223,B002EZZJSM,5,Savor an afternoon tea and give yourself the gift of Cat's Paw,A2FIZ9WFRCD9IQ,"[3, 3]","This fabulously written book drew me in.  Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down. This book is a bestseller for a reason.  It is an amazing book.  I can not recommend it highly enough.",Anna Fussell

A strong woman, Miranda, sets out on what becomes a dangerous journey as she uses every resource she has in an attempt to locate her missing husband.

Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room. The title should be ""Miranda Eats a Meat Pie for Dinner"" because that's all she really accomplishes (Seriously, someone should count up all the time they mention meat pies because it's a lot. I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic.

The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too.

The duo, along with harpooner Ned Land, end up overboard and rescued by what is revealed to be a submarine, not a mammal. This submarine is captained by Nemo, a mysterious man who has eschewed the land in preference to roaming the open seas. Nemo takes the trio twenty thousand leagues across the seas - from the Pacific to the Indian to the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Along the way, Arronax uncovers bits and pieces about his captain and catalogs the various fish he sees.Jules Verne is basically the Father of Science Fiction. His novels - such as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"" - were groundbreaking for their time. I'd go so far to say that if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the science fiction genre at all.That said, this book was supremely dry and dull most of the time. Yes, it is ""hard science fiction"" with lots of attention to detail to the mechanics of underwater ""sailing"" (some of which is incredibly on the mark; others, such as the lamp lighting the way of the Nautilus, laughable and out-dated), but there comes a point when enough is enough. This is particularly prevalent when Arronax/Verne spends multiple pages describing the flora and fauna of the sea in intricate detail (""cataloging fish"" into their species and genus) or having long conversations with other characters about irrelevant history (such as the electric cable stretching from the Americas to Ireland).Again, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail and the thought Verne put into the operation of the Nautilus. That isn't my problem. And I don't mind some detail about the sights Arronax sees while traveling. But the latter in particular ""sinks"" the story. And when the story is as diluted and sparse as it is here, that is nearly a death warrant.The majority of this novel reads as a travelogue, Google Maps directions, an account of someone's rather dull vacation. While there are a few scenes that are particularly interesting (the journey to the Antarctic and nearly being trapped underwater, a way too short squid attack, and some walking underwater scenes), by far most of the book is cataloging fish or boring ""and on Mar 21st, we sailed from X in Y direction to Z"". Yawn. What makes this is even more ridiculous is that Arronax, Ned Land, and Conseil are supposedly held prisoner aboard the Nautilus, so they do not leave and divulge its secrets elsewhere, but no one seems to care about being held against their will until suddenly they are. I'd say ""Stockholm Syndrome"", only they give a half-hearted struggle when Captain Nemo tells them they are stuck on the ship. Based on how it is written and how little concern these characters have to their captivity, I don't know why Verne didn't just have Captain Nemo invite Arronax to journey with him and maybe decide that he didn't WANT them to leave.The only (and by far the best) character in this book is Captain Nemo. Sure, there is Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land, but calling them ""characters"" is a stretch, unless you are using the most generous of definitions of ""character"". Arronax is probably the best of the trio. He has some moments of humor (as a side note, there is quite a bit of humor, and it is well applied and a good break from the blandness of most of the text) and has a complicated relationship with Nemo. Ned Land would be next. His sole character trait is wanting to kill anything that moves - whales, kangaroo, tigers, you name it. Pretty much any time he appears in the story, it's to talk about wanting to kill something or escape (and honestly, he doesn't even CONSIDER escape until the last 75% of the novel). The absolute worst character, in my opinion, is Conseil. The guy makes Saltine Crackers look like they aren't bland. If you want a cold, blindly loyal servant, this is your man.But I hesitate to blame this lack of characterization on Verne's skill as an author or the standard ""But it's hard scifi, not a character study!"", particularly when you have the complex character of Captain Nemo. What the other characters aren't, Captain Nemo is. Apparently, something bad happened to his wife and his children - something bad enough to make him abandon the land all together and sail in his boat, enacting revenge on passing ships. But he isn't a cold blooded killer - he stays Ned Land's hand, when Ned wants to harpoon a bunch of whales for the hell of it. (Of course, not more than a couple of paragraphs later, Nemo then slaughters a bunch of ""sperm whales"", so calling the guy a hypocrite is definitely in order.)So the story is meh, the characters are meh, and the descriptions are overboard. Part of that is just me not really being that hot on the book (my dad, a retired Navy submariner, and my sister both ADORE this book and think I am mad for not). That's only a small part of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"". The more important part - and the reason I think that any fan of scifi should read this book - is its influence on the genre. This is the great-great-great-great grandfather of novels like ""Ender's Game"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". So in that regard, this book is priceless - it gives me a better respect for the genre I love.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",Crystal Starr Light

Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows?  Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology.  The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism.  All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent.  The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world.  A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent.  The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity.  There is no net gain to society by this action.  The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist.  Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself.  He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress.  He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine.  A world free from governments and country in which he governs.  A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive.  A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return.  Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile.  Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive.  His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human.",Damian P.

7525,B002RKSZJO,4,The Original Science Fiction Classic,A1LW3XGXYP98BW,"[1, 1]","My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne?  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work.  It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism.  With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook.  Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may.  The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste.  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the `science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the ""speculative"" portion to explore human nature.  Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this.  And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost.  However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well.  We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions.  The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed.  Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular ""twenty thousand leagues"" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks.  There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly.  Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base.  Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as ""inoffensive creature[s],"" he gleefully slaughters a herd of ""cruel, mischievous"" sperm whales.  Hardly sustainability at its best.  But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology.  Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design).  Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented.  Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by ""foul air.""Verne wrote at an exciting time.  The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid.  We were just beginning to understand electricity.  The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered.  Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon.  There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion.  Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given.  It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword.  I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968.

But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Verne Vingt Mille English. The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan.FYI: Be aware of two other excellent, new, modern transltions of ""20,000 Leagues"" available in the Kindle Store, one by Anthony Bonner (Random) and another by Mendor Brunetti (Penguin).

Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.",T.

Most with even a passing acquaintance to sport will have picked up enough baseball facts to follow that part.  But at its heart ""Turning Back the Clock"" is more than a simple fantasy/sci-fi novel or a baseball story or a glimpse at history, although it is all of those.

I don't care how much of a genius someone is, Radio Shack is not the be-all/end-all of electronic components. If the author had just said something like, {He started scouring websites to find the parts needed} I think it would have been more believable.As to the story itself once the two men are in the past, I really enjoyed it.

Gabe, Julie's boss, has lusted after her since day one. And he hates how the co-workers take advantage of Julie's kindness and generosity. Gabe is there for her when Julie is betrayed by her boyfriend and cousin. He's there for her and sees it as the perfect opportunity to explore his attraction and feelings for her.I enjoyed the book a lot. I felt sorry for Julie.

Each chapter will focus on one, and only one, aspect of the novel. The chapters will be short because I do not have much time. I can only write in short bursts and I am easily bored.""Now, I have loved this stuff since the 60's, from William S. Burroughs on the left coast to Donald Barthelme in New York, by way of Texas. It's all called ""postmodern"", but since the early 70's we've all been heading toward post-postmodernism anyway. If you find this kind of fiction at all agreeable, you should try some Lichtenberg.For what it's worth this seems a little bit old school, and I mean that in a good way. A lot of the current work is too showy and too cute-clever. A lot of it is navel gazing and lame, maybe even spineless. Lichtenberg's work has a little more muscle. Even as he playfully suggests, over and over, that you are in charge of the reading experience as the reader, he is actually in total control of what's going on and of what you are experiencing. You are being entertained, educated and manipulated. You are being experimented on, but it will feel good, (like a lab experiment that activates the pleasure centers of your brain.)But all of this is way too heavy. This is meant on at least some level to be fun and it is. There are some marvelous turns of phrase; some playful deception; a lot of joy and a bit of subtle aggression. There is much here to think about or to just appreciate. This is a great find.I would certainly encourage you to take a look at this and see what you think.

What I most especially like is the smaller touches that bring the story home. Always the characters are flawed - but not fatally and not in any way that prohibits the love from growing. The way actions are described makes them very visceral to me. In the beginning half there is a point when they are going upstairs for the first time and Owen grabs Sterling's hand and he holds it tight and in that moment I was back at a time where my Dad did that with me before we did something important. That slight squeezing of the hand that tells you someone else is there, cares, and you are not alone. Those types of things mean that I really feel the characters.Although Sterling is a bratty sub to some extent you sense it is not out of a need to be contrary but a need to know. That let me treat and see it differently. The relationship develops slowly (sometimes painfully so) but it never left the station in spite of the issues. I didn't find this hardcore at all but then everyone has a different version of hardcore. As a masochist this fell pretty squarely on the mild to moderate side of the spectrum.

Rarely do I find a book that makes it all make perfect sense; that balances BDSM & romance without compromising either. Bound and Determined was so beautifully crafted that I could see that the Dom/sub characteristics of the characters were as intrinsic as their hair colour.

10256,B0031ESOBO,5,Moderately hardcore BDSM with a sweet touch,A3O9A7B0KJO88B,"[6, 6]","Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 9/10PROS:- The majority of the BDSM books I've read have included two (or three) people who are already in the scene or one who sort of stumbles onto it accidentally. This story contains a character who's a total novice but goes actively searching for what he feels he's been missing.- The story doesn't just focus on all the wonderful things that happen during Sterling's initiation into BDSM. It covers the difficulties too: the misunderstandings, the fears, the failures...and the relationship seems all the stronger for those things.- I loved how pushy Sterling is (and how nonchalant he is about it), especially when the two men are first getting to know each other. He's determined to snag Owen by researching not only BDSM, but also the specific things Owen is into--even after Owen has turned him down.- I also loved how Owen is so puzzled by his reaction to Sterling but never allows his bewilderment to show. He's a stoic Dom the vast majority of the time during the initial phase of their relationship, but he's losing his heart a piece at a time.- I'm a huge fan of books that hold off on sex until there's been some buildup, and boy, does this book have the buildup on that account. Quite a nice payoff, too, when it finally happens.CONS:- Some of the scenes ended before I felt like they should have, and some of the fairly important/momentous things the guys do together occur offstage. (That is, they're not shown; they're simply mentioned briefly in passing, like, ""oh, by the way, this happened, but on we go..."")- There's a scene late in the story when the two main characters are apart that I found extremely unpleasant and difficult to read.- One of the minor-but-still-significant plot elements is wrapped up at the end of the book a little too quickly/conveniently.Overall comments: I really enjoyed this book. The characterization is solid, and I found the story sweet but not overly so. Owen and Sterling's interactions had me hooked right from the start; their preconceived notions about each other make for some deliciously charged scenes, both sexual and non-sexual.",Charly T.

10261,B0031ESOBO,4,4.5 stars. A very emotional story,A1RXR105ND8OSH,"[1, 1]","4.5 stars.I really enjoyed this book because the relationship between Owen, the Dom, and Sterling, the sub, develops slowly and because it sort of starts from wrong premises.At the very beginning of the book Sterling tries to channel his frustration about his strained relationship with his father into a BDSM relationship, thinking of being a natural Dom. During his first night in a club he understands that he craves being a sub and he sets his eyes on Owen, his former professor, who initially refuses him. Sterling is stubborn and he stalks Owen until the Dom accepts him.Their relationship is very interesting because probably it's not easy to bring to submission a young man, like Sterling, who wants things his way, but Owen has the patience and restraint of a saint. Sterling is naturally undisciplined, but it's because it seems impossible for him to accepts the rules imposed by Owen at their face value, he wants to know the whys and hows, in a way he wants their relationship to be balanced. Owen is not a perfect Dom, and with that I mean that he is not one of the masters that get everything right at their first try, reading their subs as if they were books. On the contrary, he has his doubts, he realizes that he has to cave in sometimes, what I liked about him is that he really wants to help and teach Sterling. I'd say that this book falls on the lighter side of BDSM.I can't give a full rating because it wasn't really overwhelming for me. Maybe Owen was too gentle and too wise, but I think he should have pushed Sterling a little more, just to make everything a little bit more intense.",manutwo

I've got books by both authors and their styles compliment each other hugely and make for very cool reading.Sterling is such a brat and I loved his spark and innate cheekiness. It is such a perfect foil for Owen's more reserved nature and theirs is a relationship that doesn't always go smoothly as a result. The conflict was well written with the focus centered on the characters internal struggles. It was easy to read and didn't devolve into any silly BDSM tropes and Nancy Drew and the gang did not make an appearance I was pleased to note. heh.The relationship between Sterling and Owen is what carries this book. The slow development of trust between both men and the exploration of their boundaries, desires, and the chemistry that has drawn them together, was what made this a cut above other BDSM novels I've read recently. Nothing was rushed and the authors seemed to allow Sterling and Owen to stick to their own timetable. The slow building of sexual tension as a result was off the charts and appealed to me immensely. The sex is incredibly good and they nailed that sense of trust implicit within a D/s relationship. Rawr.

Something I loved so much about him was how kind, caring, empathetic, and authentic he was.There were so many passages that I enjoyed in Big Bad Wolf.&#34;Everything exploded at once. Her body, her blood, the colors and sounds surrounding her. It all ripped and fell, melting into liquid heat before it rained over her.

While this book is the first I've read by this author, it's actually a reread for me (the first time being around 2 years ago). I liked this story (obviously) and am willing to try more of Black's work in the future.Vivien is a nice lady that owns a bakery. She was married at one point but her husband was a weasle and they were divorced 6 years ago. Vivien moved back to her home town where her grandmother (who raised her) lives and opened her bakery there. Vivien hasn't been involved with anyone recently but has been secretly drooling over the local carpenter, Rex.Rex is a werewolf and works in his home town as a carpenter. He lost parents and siblings when he was young due to some bad shifters that killed them. Rex has been alone since then, not wanting to join another pack. He also hasn't found any woman he's felt comfortable getting involved with because of being a were but he's been wanting Vivien and has a hard time not going after her.Vivien goes out to her Grandmother's place after work to take her food because she's not feeling well. When she get there, Vivien and her Grandmother are attacked by what appears to be a wild dog. Vivien get bitten while trying to protect her Grandmother but isn't too badly hurt. Rex shows up just in time and manages to run the beast off. In addition to the bite, Vivien hit her head in the struggle and (after seeing a doctor) needs to be looked after for the night. Since Vivien's Grandmother is sick, Rex offers to have Vivien stay at his place so he can watch after her. Vivien doesn't want to impose but is convinced it's for the best. Rex and Vivien get to his cabin and don't get very much further before the attraction that's been sizzling between them comes to a head. They have some hot sex on the couch and then go upstairs to indulge in more. The next day, I was pleasantly surprised with Vivien's reaction. Although she's on the BBW side, Vivien doesn't freak out about why Rex wants her and didn't get all weird and try to sneak out without him seeing her out of some mis-placed idea that it was only a one night thing. Instead, Vivien gets up happy about the great sex and goes to join Rex for breakfast. They take the day off of work and spending the day together. Vivien wonders how everyone will react to her and Rex getting together so quickly but is pleasantly surprised that the townsfolk are happy that she and Rex finally got together (and have secretly been hoping for it for a while).Things go well for Vivien and Rex and they spend the next few weeks together, enjoying their new relationship and blooming feelings. They quickly started spending every night together and have cloths at each other's houses. Vivien is embracing the relationship and she's not sure where it's going but she's going to enjoy it as much as she can for as long as she can. There's a minor issue with Vivien's Ex, who was dumped by the woman he dumped Vivien for and he suddenly thinks that it's Vivien's responsibility to take care of him. I loved seeing him learn his lesson because he so deserved it. There are some more important issues that need to be dealt with and as time passes, Rex knows he has to talk to Vivien about these issues. Rex needs to tell Vivien about his being a were but he also need to let her know that the animal that bit her wasn't a wild dog but a rogue werewolf and what that means for her. As expected, there's some drama before the end, both with Vivien's reaction to Rex's news and also the return of the rogue who's after Vivien. Fortunately, Vivien and Rex are able to get past the difficulties and come together to start their HEA.This was a very enjoyable story. I liked both Vivien and Rex very much. Both characters were likable and I couldn't help rooting for them to get together. The story wasn't perfect but I enjoyed it very much (obviously since this is a reread).

When a deathbed confession of the stepfather recants his original testimony and his brother-in-law and former friend is released from prison, he set out to catch him; we are never sure what he intended to do when he caught up with him as in this book, he states, he clearly prefers to hand villains over to the law.

She is dresses as a lad and there are some bullies making fun of her. The hero who had expected to feel some kind of victory feeling, steps in. The heroine explains to him that she wants to hire him to help her gain her inheritance back which was stolen from. He really does not want to do it but she mentions a name, apparently the foreman on her ranch, who had been a friend of the hero. The person who stole her ranch also killed that friend.He finally agrees but makes it clear it will be done his way or not at all and that he will first go to see his friend to give him the news about his late wife's murderer. The hero is certain that the lad has not told him the full truth and waits for the other shoe to drop. While heading to the small town where our hero believes his former brother-in-law is, they are ambushed in a store and the lad is injured. Now, our hero knows that that Kyle is actually Kyla. While he is not amused, he grudgingly respects her.  When they arrive at his brother-in-law's home, where he wants the heroine to recuperate, they find it abandoned. Now the hero is forced to become close to the heroine by taking care of her. He does not want anyone to know that he is a she, as he has heard that her enemies are looking for her and for some reason also for him. Due to a nosy neighbor, they have to leave sooner than the hero wants; he wanted her to be in better shape.As they get to know each other better, he learns the reason why she is so good in her disguise as a lad.  He begins to admire her more and more but can't admit to himself that he loves her. He never knew a happy home life and feels it is way too late for him to think about one. It does not stop him of dreaming of one. The heroine, who has good reason to not trust men in general, slowly but surely falls in love with the hero and she hopes, she can make him stay once they have dealt with their enemies.It takes another near death experience of the heroine for the hero to take a job offer which would let him stay, one he had told her previously, was not for him.Again, the s*x scene were beautifully written, not shy, not flowery or clinical, just beautiful.",angela longstaffe

It's an improbable (to start) love story between bounty hunter Jace Rankin and ranch owner Kyla Springer Bailey.  Kyla has lost posession of her ranch, and her innocence, to her step brother Tom Hardesty. He has a thing for brutal rape as is demonstrated more than once in the book. He is a member of the corrupt Vigilance Union.Kyla travels to find help disguised as Kyle, a snot nosed teenage boy with less than no manners.

By the end, I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself to finish because of an attachment to the characters and their plight. That's the good news.Many other reviewers have commented upon the same thing that drove me batty: Missing words, sometimes entire phrases or partial paragraphs, caused frequent reading stumbles. The problem grew worse the further I read, until by the end, every page -- and sometimes every paragraph on every page -- resembled Swiss cheese.Normally, I excuse minor formatting errors in ebooks. Mistakes happen. Often, the publisher (or the author, if the book is self-published) discovers the problem and issues a corrected version as soon as possible. More than two years after its release, the desperately flawed Kindle version remains unfixed, and the glitches are anything but minor. Why? To me, such an oversight indicates, at best, a lack of attention to the market; at worst a callous disrespect for readers.I enjoy Alexis Harrington's work, but my disappointment with the completely fixable flaws in the Kindle edition was so severe I do not foresee investing in her future ebook endeavors.",Disorderly Words

He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words.

I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.

I was wrong, very wrong. ""Frame-Up,"" by Mr. Christopherson and co-author Brad Schoenfeld, is every bit the equal of ""Crack-Up"" for ratcheting up the tension as the reader wonders if Will Pruett will really be executed for a murder he framed himself on.Even after will realizes that he's been suckered into framing himself for the murder of a cop, it's no certainty that he can escape the death penalty. His only hope lies in convincing police detectives Ortiz and Dyrstad of his innocence, not an easy job, especially with the Manhattan DA pushing for quick justice to help his struggling campaign for re-election. Fortunately for Will, the two detectives are determined to find the truth, despite having to sift through the red herrings in their way.There are some memorable characters in ""Frame-Up."" Will Pruett is cool as a cucumber as he goes through the arrest process, but he never bargained on the dangers waiting for him at the jail on Rykers Island.

It was one-half police procedural and one-half thriller with a regular guy trying to figure out the clues.The book has an outstanding opening sentence that automatically made me want to read further. However, the first scene suffered to provide it, as the author(s) had to backtrack to ""fill-in"". This backtracking was not very well done and caused a little confusion.The story progressed at a pretty fast clip, taking me along for the ride at a fast trot. New twists kept the story interesting with no filler added. The book also managed to give an interesting view of capital punishment without ever becoming `preachy'.I found the mystery to be well-planned and well-executed in the writing. However, my first thought when the nefarious person (or persons) were uncovered was, ""Why go to all that trouble?"" I didn't feel the author addressed that question in enough depth.I'm still trying to decide if I liked the dual scenes at the end of the book. It certainly kept me enthralled, but I think that it could have been better told linearly. I kept trying to picture it as a movie with cut-scenes/flashbacks, and that almost worked.Character Development: 5 StarsWill was a very nicely developed character that any reader could empathize with somewhat. I do admit to wondering at times, ""Do all young, black (or African American, if you prefer, but I'm old...LOL) degreed professionals really think in terms of so much slang?"" However, I can't take off for that because I, of course, have no idea what goes on in the minds of others. Also, it was relatively believable and gave Will's character more depth.Sam, the lead detective on the case, was also a very good character. She was pretty and smart, without being a model or a genius. In other words, she was `real'.My favorite character is actually the little old German lady. I was amazed at how well the author(s) portrayed the ""German attitude."" I lived in Germany for three years and found many Germans to be of similar personality as this woman.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe sentence structuring is excellent thoughout the book. One thing I did not find here was a disparity between chapters that belied the fact that there were two authors. I could not tell who wrote what, which made me wonder if only one wrote while the other had ideas? Either way, the writing flowed smoothly from beginning to end.The dialogue was filled with rich voices, giving each person their own distinct one. The descriptions were vivid, almost too much so when describing certain scenes.Editing: 4 3/4 StarsAlthough the grammatical editing was of professional caliber, I have to mark this section down a bit because of the dead man talking at the end. Yes, there is a scene with a man named Finch, but ""Lynch"" seems to change facial expressions and talk several times. Unfortunately, ""Lynch"" is the dead man that Will framed himself for killing in the beginning of the book, so I was pretty certain that he wasn't chatting it up with the cops at the end of the book. It was pretty funny.Rating: R for Graphic Violence, Blood, Gore, Adult Situations****This review was originally posted on my blog.

11644,B00347AI9Y,4,A Kindleobsessed Review,AFUQ93IMBSVR4,"[4, 5]","It has been a while (I hate to confess) since I have committed my brain to the inner workings of a ""cop thriller,"" but I am ecstatic to say that I still have that ""need"" to figure ""it"" out.There are few things better than trying to figure out a mystery, this is the exact reason television shows like CSI, and Bones have thrived for so long. The viewer, or reader (in this case,) is given a handful of situations and asked to figure out their significance, but right when you think you have it, the author takes those pieces, throws them into a Yahtzee cup, shakes them up and you have to start again.In ""Frame-Up"" Eric Christopherson and Brad Schoenfeld do exactly that.Will is a magazine journalist who's life is about to change. On a mission to make an example out of New York's legal system he does the unthinkable...he frames himself for a murder he didn't commit. What murder exactly? A racially motivated murder of a New York police officer. Hoping to get some insight (and maybe a Pulitzer) Will takes the plunge and lands himself in the slammer, but when his ""search for the ultimate story"" starts to become a little ""too real"" he is desperate to find a way out. Is it to late to take back all of the evidence he stacked against himself, and will the people that helped him get there have his back or will they leave him hanging?While this is not necessarily a traditional ""who done it"" (more a unique way of spouting the authors political views) the writing/plot elements are still the same. The ""focused"" plot is immediately established in the opening sequence of the novel, and is then followed up by sub-connecting plots which are inserted to create a web of conflicting clues. The pace was quick and solid, leaving no time for the reader to nod off, and the characters (with 1 exception) were very will established and superbly detailed in not only their personal but business persona's.There was, however... one VERY notable problem with character development (this is the aforementioned exception) ""Will"" is a very (highly) educated man. He not only spouts a private primary education, but a degree from Columbia, so the authors need to fill his inner and peer dialogue with rough Ebonics not only felt misplaced, but in places came across as ridiculous or offensive. Establishment of this character as having ""come from the ghetto"" was clear, and the authors' constant need to reiterate his education made his use of words like ""fo shizzle"" sickeningly unbelievable and had me rolling my eyes.This novel was by no means perfect, but the twists and turns were enough to make it enjoyable. Approximately 70% of the way in the plot gets smacked around making it hard to put down, and though then ending of the novel left a little to be desired, I wouldn't call it a deal breaker.All in all? Intelligent story, captivating plot.Get it, Live it, Love it... pass it on.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: never leave ALL of your ""evidence"" with 1 person... what if they suddenly decide they hate you?",Misty Baker

11646,B00347AI9Y,4,A Few Minor Execution Problems with this Death Penalty Mystery,A39NQQ8DO9OI66,"[1, 2]","This book was plotted well. An Ivy-league educated black journalist, Will Pruett, frames himself as the murderer of a corrupt policeman, with the hopes of overturning New York's death penalty. This was his boss's idea, but after much deliberation, he goes ahead with the plan. Things turn ugly quickly as he finds himself incarcerated on Riker's Island. He wants out - but now, his boss refuses to take his calls and he's facing a trial that has enough circumstantial evidence to where a conviction appears likely - and enough aggravating factors to warrant a sentence of death.It's an interesting premise, and the authors do a good job in taking the reader through the twists and turns of the police system. However, there were enough holes to drop my rating from five stars to only four stars.First of all, as other reviewers have mentioned, there seems to be an underlying racism in the book, beyond what is needed to make the plot work effectively. Although Pruett is a professional and educated man, his language becomes ""ghetto-ized"" quickly when in the company of his black billionaire friend, Louis, in a way that seems to stretch credibility. There are other examples throughout the book that added nothing to the plot but served to remind us that minorities do suffer discrimination. I don't condone racism in any manner, but I thought that the way that it was done detracted from the story.Secondly, there were quite a few typos, especially in the last quarter of the book.Finally, Pruett seemed too nave. It seems as if most people, if they were in a similar situation, would make a hundred copies of whatever supporting evidence existed to prove their innocence. They'd give a copy to their parents, their friends, put a copy in their safety deposit box, bury a copy in their yard, whatever. He seemed totally unprepared for prison life and not the sort of person who would have likely put himself in that position, even for professional means.Despite the shortcomings, it was an interesting book and I enjoyed reading it.

An enjoyable life comes at a price of a shortened existence.From the arrogance of the ill-fated explorers in Angelorum Orbis, to the bravado of youth in The Taste of Clouds and the twisted, almost steampunk visions of Tellers - this is a view of an efficient but disturbing society that reflects a twisted belief of the value of existence.At times disturbing, always entertaining and clever - The First is a great starter for anyone wanting to get into Scott Nicholson's work.

However, I am judging the book solely on how it is written and I think that it does a good job of causes the right amount of disgust and horror to keep people who like this genre interested.A few words of warning, this story has very graphic scenes of brutal murders so people who are easily squeamish may not want to read this one. Also, there is a lot of vulgar language in the story, which fits with who the character is, but I am mentioning this for those (like me) who absolutely do not want to read books with that in it.It is a VERY quick read, as it is a short story, and there is actually a part two to this book, which is quite obvious with how the story ended.

I was all for it, of course, because, after all, I fell in love with his work when I read his horror thrillers Cry Of The Fallen and A Death At the North Pole. I didn't know what to expect with this one, though, for it was just 14 pages long. But, I was super happy with the outcome, that's for sure!In just a few short pages, Joel takes brutality to a whole new level. Charley Walker is out to seek revenge for his father's death. After all, it killed his mother, too. So, he starts with 3 innocent women......all connected to his fathers death.I could literally feel myself transforming into Charley Walker. I felt his vengeance. I felt his anger and pain. But, I was also the 3 women. Every fear, every scream, became mine. I can't believe how real the horror felt to me! The brutality with which Charley Walker put forth was absolutely, gruesomely, amazing.Well, so much for a short review! But, I couldn't help myself. This was AWESOME. I highly, highly recommend this story to everyone who loves a good combination of thrilling horror, gruesome scenes and spine tingling fear.

When I first started reading I thought `okay another character-building story where man sees hot woman sitting in the bar across the way and man then decides to approach woman for quickie sex. Boy was I wrong! Right about the time I read this sentence: ""He was an angel of no mercy"" I knew I was in for a special kind of reading treat.The next few paragraphs validate my thinking. And I begin to fear for the three women that have been targeted in the book. Plus, being a sucker for gorgeous writing (at least one or two metaphors here and there) I was totally sucked into this brief story. The author has a skillful way of foreshadowing brutality without giving too much away as he did in this sentence: ""The sheep herded into their casket."" at this point in the story, I was screaming at the women, telling them to watch out.After that, the story goes the path of true old-fashioned horror. Not terror, but gut wrenching, gives you chills horror. This is not a story for the faint of heart. The only thing I didnt really like was the length. True, Charlie wasn't just evil without a cause, but I'd like to have had the chance to find out what happens after the ending scene. If you're going to read horror then you should be aware that sometimes endings aren't always tidy and clean on either the physical or the emotional level. This isn't fantasy. This is a story that explores the darkest side of the human mind. And sometimes that means a not very happy ending.I'd recommend this short story to any horror fan. 4-stars.",Read2Review

He is the best pilot the Galaxy of Free Systems ""GFS"" has. His equally talented first mate gunner, Joslyne, happens to also be his wife. They feel secure in the knowledge that should the end come during battle, they would perish together.Some believe that the GFS has grown too large, too bureaucratic for the regular person across the galaxy. This small group of rebels is slowly, but steadily, growing in numbers. Brit Hyram, the overall head of the Rebellion, is the public face of the secessionist movement. Though idealistic, neither he, nor any other within the Rebellion, has any real understanding of military tactics. The simulators used to train new recruits are woefully outdated. Therefore, the GFS pilots have little trouble winning the skirmishes on land or in space. But then the Rebellion suddenly has a blast cannon on their side.President Greensteen and Admiral Zephyr send Ryann to lead a strike team on a ground assault to destroy the cannon. Ryann has extra orders to secretly assassinate a certain individual while there. Having to kill someone face-to-face and in cold blood does not sit well with Ryann. So when he is later asked to assassinate another, Ryann and Joslyne defect.The Rebel Secessionist Movement is thrilled to have the best GFS pilot and gunner team join their cause. The new duo will have to earn the trust of Hyram and the other leaders, but they are put to work immediately. Joslyne's expertise is used to update simulators for target practice and the like. Ryann begins teaching military maneuvers to the pilots and updating the equipment on all the ships.Joslyne still has doubts about what they are doing. As Ryann rises in rank and power at lightning speed, he begins to change. Even personally executing former friends and comrades no longer seems to bother Ryann. Joslyne soon wonders to what lengths her husband would go, how low he would sink, and how cold blooded he would become for his new beliefs. And can she continue to stand beside the man he is morphing into?**** FOUR STARS! A terrific science fiction tale that begins in the fighter cockpit and later takes on the flavor of high military leadership with some power hungry sycophants. My only real problem with this story is that there are a few strategy plans that are repeated too often. If I, as the reader, hear the plan when it is made, then there is no reason for me to hear it explained one or two more times as other characters are educated about it. Simply knowing the plan is told to the other character(s) is fine. But having to hear it retold within a few pages or chapter becomes boring and annoying. However, this problem only seems to happen for the first one-third (1/3) of the book.All-in-all, I am very impressed with the creative imagination of John Fitch, V. Though not as focused on in-depth military strategy details (such as with David Weber and Dan Abner novels), this author shows a keenness in understanding how power can corrupt even the best of people. It also makes one wonder just how far some would go to fulfill their sense of duty. Highly recommended! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.","Detra Fitch ""Always hunting good books."""
14749,B003B66AQI,4,Involving story,A3AREYIU8VOJUP,"[2, 3]","A Galaxy at War is an involving story of military battles in space, with the unusual twist that two of the main protagonists - Ryann and Joslyne, who met in flight school - are married to each other. The sexual chemistry between them is obvious, with Joslyne the quicker, cleverer, more mischievous of the two, and Ryann steadier; determined to carry out his mission whatever the cost. And there is a cost.During the course of the book, Ryann's relationships with the people he loves - including Joslyne - are put to the test. By the end of the book, he has paid a terrible price for what he believes in.I liked the relationship between Ryann and Joslyne, and the details Fitch puts into the story to bring it to life and make an imagined future world seem believeable - the holoconferences, for example, and (horrible thought) the techno-chains. The names for the characters and the objects/locations in the world also appealed to me: Admiral Zephyr, Firespray, Ozonacropolis.There was a good balance between battles and human relationships which made this a very readable story with a surprisingly moving ending.",Helen Smith

Have you ever started out disliking something, grew to appreciate it, then loathe it, have it grow on you once more, become ready to throw it away, and finally put it down, wait a few days, and then say, ""I'm not sure what I read, but it just might be brilliant?""This, in a nutshell, was my experience reading ""A Galaxy At War"" by John Fitch V.""A Galaxy At War"" is the story of Ryann Germayne, a pilot for the GFS (Galaxy of Free Systems).  It seems that the GFS rules its universe with a sort of aluminum fist.  It makes demands on the planets under its control and will not let them govern themselves, and yet though most of the book they seem a bit weak and pathetic for what is portrayed as a powerful political entity.Long story short, the Rebels are fighting back against the cruel rule of the GFS, and Ryann and his wife, Joslyne, who is the gunner on their ship, The Tub, traverse space, trying to hold back the Rebels any way they can.At first, I thought this book was a parody.  There are so many clich&eacute;s throughout the first third of it.  You have the witty banter between Ryann and Joslyne (""hotshot"" and ""flyboy""?), a robot assistant who can speak hundreds of languages, and political intrigue that really isn't that intriguing.  Add to this the humor that comes from the overuse of the term ""photonics"" (why is it red and green and what does that mean?) and the fact that everyone's favorite drink is ""stimu-tonic"" (what, coffee's not good enough in space?) and you have the perfect ingredients for satire.However, after a while, those elements disappear and the tone becomes muddled.  Allegiances flip-flop for seemingly no reason at all.  There are severely over-explained plans that are far from complex and yet presented as such.  During this time, I seriously considered putting down the book.Come the end, I was glad I didn't.Something strange happened along the way while I was rolling my eyes at the text.  All of a sudden the tone became dark and serious, and the writing reflected as such.  The characters' previous actions began to make sense.  It all came upon me quickly, as if I hadn't been paying attention the whole time and it only just then popped into my brain and screamed at me to look closer.  It became more than a space opera, turning into something meaningful, something that would make the 9/11 conspiracy theorists proud.So I didn't write my review immediately afterwards and sat on the book for a few days.  In that time, it's gained greater notoriety in my head.  The themes make sense, and the humor does, too.  I think I finally understand what Mr. Fitch was trying to accomplish with it, and in the opinion of this reviewer he pulled it off.In other words, try out A Galaxy At War.  By the time you're done, I think you'll have enjoyed it...though it might take a while to figure out why you did.","JOA ""Journal of Always Reviews"""

Part of the story was set in Yosemite, a lovely place filled with romance and delight.Hannah Johns, preacher's daughter who now makes a life for herself and young son, David, as a supper club singer, dreams big.

Based on the positive reviews I figured that it would be a nice diversion on a long commute home from work. However I spent my time slightly annoyed and perplexed to the point where I skimmed the book rather than read it fully.  I found the main character very... childish and silly... not to mention the many annoying times she said ""Isn't it Romantic"" when there was (***SPOILER***) NOTHING romantic about convincing a guy to pose as a fake husband then bulling the man into doing everything that she asked- even though he was doing her the favor. She was unsympathetic to his ""allergy"" to dogs and within one day already tried to change him into her picturesque dream guy. I found it to be a complete mystery that he would fall in love with her so quickly and that, with such an overbearing father, she would even bother pretending to have a husband just to make him happy.  What was supposed to be zany and humorous was silly and sophomoric. I am sorry that I did not listen to the negative review. So...was it awful?

Cody was some where between crazy and just plain weird but very endearing and funny as heck. Kipling had to be a bit off his rocker as well or maybe he was just smitten by Cody and his nuttery was direct result of that.

Some are kind while others are downright overly critical and brutal.  When I came across this short story, I figured I would give it a try while I wait for other books I ordered and let me tell you.... it was a nice change for me.  Albeit the story was at a fast pace which makes it unbelievable and quite far fetched, but lets be honest with each other....  when it comes down to romance novels... it is a hit-or-miss thing.  I can only guess it is in the expectations of the reader to love it or hate it, but I will say I liked this book just fine.  There was a smooth flow to how the story progressed without too much character background.  I actually appreciated the instant attraction and the level of comfort in an uncomfortable situation.  The drama did not drag out to a painful level and the ending was resolved rather quickly, but for 99 cents....  it was worth every penny to me.And really.... who wouldn't just love having a person fall for you wholeheartedly in the matter of a couple of days?  Isn't that what people grasp upon when they turn to romance stories?  That happily ever after?  I know that is what I look for because I know that in real life....  things are never as smooth as the fiction we read.

15372,B003DA4FFK,3,More Cute Than Romatic,A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"[3, 3]","Kipling Stanton fell into acting and became a Hollywood star. When the science fiction television show he starred in ended it's run, he left the celebrity life for a quieter existence in a small town in Virginia where he could be himself without all the celebrity hoopla. His hopes for a quieter life are quickly dashed, however. Not because the paparazzi find him - that would be far to...normal. No, Kip's hopes for some peace and quiet are disrupted by a foxy redheaded neighbor with a fine butt and a propensity for asking strangers to marry her. Cody doesn't really want to get married, but her father told her he's desperately sick. He's going to be visiting for a week and she sort of told him she'd gotten married to ease his mind about her, and now she's one husband short and about to be another big disappointment. Kipling is good looking, and most importantly, convenient, so Cody jumps on the chance to ask him this monumentally large...and patently insane favor as they meet for the first time over the hedge between their properties.Kip, wary of women throwing themselves at him, is convinced Cody's either crazy or manipulating him, but Cody's harmless. She's a romantic. A dreamer. And she has no idea that she just pseudo proposed to the star of a beloved television show. All she knows is she's very attracted to him, and apparently, he's just as attracted to her. Isn't it romantic?Honestly, it really isn't. In fact, the premise of this contemporary romance novella is more than a little corny. Perhaps if it had been longer and there had been more time to introduce Kip and Cody to each other before Cody pops the question it would have had a different tone, but as it is, it seems a bit too rushed and silly to be realistic. That is a trend that continues through the story as Cody's father and her best friend are added into the mix. The narrative is a bit repetitive, with Kip going back and forth with the thought that Cody has ulterior motives and Cody waxing on and on about everything being romantic. The dialogue suffered a bit in several spots, and more than once I had a hard time believing adults would talk or act the way the characters did. Cody's inability to stand up for herself against her father was a bit of a downer, as well.All that being said, however, I can't help but admit that Isn't It Romantic? does have charm, and a surprising, but delightful bit of humor in it. While the plot and narrative lack sophistication, I enjoyed the story as a lighthearted, harmless contemporary romance. I enjoyed Kip, who I felt was a bit more fleshed out than Cody, and while the mind boggled at why he was going along with this insane neighbor of his, I did buy into a couple of his issues with self doubt about his acting ability and his fear of dogs.By the end, I was left feeling Isn't It Romantic? is a simple, cute romance novella. It's not terribly believable, but it was entertaining and I don't regret the time spent reading it. It also get points for providing an epilogue that let us see a glimpse of Kip and Cody's future. Not only did the epilogue fit quite well with an organic progression of their relationship, but it provided a satisfying sense of closure to a truly happy ending both emotionally and professionally for both of them and I liked that very much. Despite the issues, I finished Isn't It Romantic? with a smile and a happy feeling and that's good enough for me.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another"""

Max Chase is an antihero with a conflicted past in the Jack Reacher mold -- yet very much his own man -- who is surprised to discover that he has a soft spot for struggling single-mom waitress Sharon and her sullen yet spunky teen daughter, Glory. All three are fully realized characters that the reader comes to care about as they weave in and out of the clutches of a gang of hardened professionals criminals bent on using the storm as cover to keep a hidden secret from slipping into the wrong hands. The prose is taut, artful in places, andIf I had any quibbles, it's that I would have liked to have seen author J.D. Rhoades raise the stakes for the reader by giving the bad guys just as much backstory and breadth of character. When you care almost as much about the baddies as you do the good guys, it creates a delicious moral ambiguity that makes it much harder to see the black hats go down -- as, inevitably, they must. But ""Storm Surge"" still satisfies on just about every level, and it says something deeply unpleasant about the publishing industry that it took a pass on this highly commercial story and forced Rhoades to put it out himself.

Since I got my Kindle a year and a half ago I have downloaded over 160 books. Due to financial challenges many of them the Free or .99 cent ones. I'm sure you all know that with some of the Free ones you get what you paid for, but STORM SURGE I promise you is not in that category. I decided it was high time I started giving some of these authors credit for their work by at least taking the time to post a review. The plot and setting of the book was creative, fast paced and suspenseful -- innocent people stranded on an island with an ensuing hurricane and tornado with some really bad villains and a villain that is really good (relatively speaking); death, deception, thievery, double-crossing, truth, lies,  and a code to live by. Romance interest that wasn't too corny and women that weren't too whiney. A good quick read that was hard to put down and would make a great movie with Jason Stathom playing Mercer!

Though a novella, it was still a bit long to read in one sitting, but I still wanted to.The set-up was interesting with a criminal as the main character. James Straley is not your average protagonist. Somehow, I disliked him, yet felt sorry for him at the same time. As a matter of fact, my dislike actually grew throughout the first half of the story. As the story progressed, he did become more likeable, showing some real emotional and psychological growth. However, I did feel that the ""growth"" went a bit too quickly for the permanence implied.I wasn't thrilled with the ending. Although it reminded me a little of King's ""Thinner,"" it went a little too far south into the realm of the unbelievable for me. While there was a twist at the end, it did not have enough buildup, leaving me feeling a bit cheated.While somewhat uncertain of the underlying moral, assuming there was one, I still felt the story had a deep psychological tone.Writing Style: 5 StarsThis novella contained the wonderfully tight, yet lyrical, writing I have come to expect from Mr. Wood. With a style perfect for the horror genre, Mr. Wood uses his time-tested techniques to ratchet up the suspense.  The descriptions were bold and filled with gruesome imagery when warranted.

Reincarnation is a tricky subject since it immediately alienates many religious groups and holds the possibility for the author to instruct rather than tell a story. Genia Stemper, however, is not a prophet, she is a very talented and thoughtful writer. She treads her way through the ethereal with such aplomb that the reader can almost hear the 'Woosh' of time fly by as the protagonists learn, live and die through the lessons of reality towards their fate.The reader is transported, with tsunami-like power, through the ages while true-love attempts to find its place and its peace. The author's attention to the setting for each of the protagonists' lifetimes is astonishingly detailed. Rich aromas waft from the pages in the descriptions of beautiful gardens, seaside vistas and dangerous fires. The fruit from each tree is so well remembered by the author that you, the reader, will taste its fruits' nectar on your tongue. The book, and each historical place and time are well researched and infused with a vibrancy that bounds from the pages into the imagination, creating a backdrop that is almost tactile, to stage the tragedies, triumphs and trifles of life.From a glimpse of life as an Indian Princess to the burden of life as a rice-paddy slave, this read is an indulgence that will not only entertain you, engage you emotionally, but also leave you glowing with the warmth of its gloriously romantic notion that love may endure and not simply be swept away by time.","Bookish Girl ""For the love of books"""

On the one hand, there is A LOT of action (which I'm a huge fan of) and the writing is high-quality. On the other hand, I just couldn't lose myself in this book like I wanted to.I'm not sure I'm a fan of all the POVs given and there were several times POV jumps pulled me out of the story. This may be a book I would have enjoyed more if it had only been told from one or two POVs. I really didn't like the narration from the three bad guys' perspective: I felt Rudolph was just evil without motivation, which is one of my biggest pet peeves. And seeing so much from their perspective lost some of the suspense.The pacing of the action was excellent and there was always some exciting car chase or nail-biting fight scene around the corner. However, the pacing - in terms of information - was a little off. For the first half or so, I felt bored by explanations of obvious things and then all of a sudden there are all these fantastic plot twists that are revealed with bland recaps. I also would have liked to be given more hints earlier as to what the Oz Project was - it was mentioned repeatedly, but no actual information was given until a big info dump when the ... (trying to phrase as to avoid spoilers) Project is ""used.""I wasn't a huge fan of the dialogue, especially in emotional scenes. It felt stilted and didn't evoke the emotions that were described for me.Also, I didn't buy all the times the hero won the fights (against hardened killers and attackers with superhuman strength), got out of certain situations, etc. He was just a little too lucky for my tastes. I couldn't bring myself to care for him either - I didn't care that he got his son back or whether or not he reconciled with his wife.All that being said, I did feel compelled to read on in search of an HEA. The action and plot are fast-moving, original and entertaining.After writing this, I see a few reviewers compare the author to Dean Koontz - and that may be part of my problem... I've never been a Koontz fan.ConclusionIf you like lots of action, you might want to check this one out.

Otherwise, I'd probably give it a 3 1/2 to 4 rating.  The action sequences were well-written.  The storyline didn't have any major holes in it; however, killing everyone in the way of the ending was a bit much.  The uber-Oz monkeys were a bit much. An F-35 in downtown Las Vegas was a bit much.What that adds up to is a fairly good storyline that was carried too far on the believability scale.  All the pieces were there, but it felt contrived.

Characters are nuanced; imperfect but very likable.  Even the ""villains"" have moments of being accessible.  The story itself is lively and engrossing ... reminds me a bit of 1950's Heinlein.  The future society is an interesting one, and the door is certainly open for sequels.  The beginning of the novel is especially strong -- we're dropped into the story in medias res, and hurtled along through the opening scenes.

This is a minor point and does not detract from the story or major points in the novel. For those who are on the fence about trying this novel because of overt sexual content due to the title there is VERY minimal action of that kind in the book - very PG in that regard (sorry to those who were looking forward to that kind of action). I was looking forward to seeing what happend next for the characters (there is an excerpt from book 2 at the end of the novel with a note of it possibly being published in 2012) but realised after investigating on Amazon that the anticipated sequel has not yet been released.

18776,B003P2VH98,5,Excellent World Building,A37LI9FSI99T77,"[10, 10]","Boulter hooked me in the sample. His set up for the main plot, introduction of the primary characters, and clever world-building grabbed me by the brain and I punched ""buy it now"" as soon as I hit the link at the end of the sample.I place this in the same camp of SciFi/Romance as Linnea Sinclair and she's one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Boulter does a masterful job of twining three plots - the ""large"" plot involving the greed of the corporate overlords, the main ""romance"" plot involving Jazz and Johannes, and an interesting subplot involving Johannes and his brother. While definitely squarely in cliche country, the three pieces kept the story unfolding at a very engaging pace and I found Boulter's treatment of them sufficiently interesting to move the cliche to trope. Well done!As much as I liked this book, I think it had one flaw:- All three main characters (Matt, Johannes, Jazz) stray just a bit too close to 'intentionally stupid.' You know when the plot requires the character to be just a touch too inflexible? Or do something just a bit too dumb for somebody that's supposed to be smart enough to know better? (Oooh, I wonder what's behind this door marked ""do not enter"" - what could go wrong?) It wasn't bad, just maybe, one beat too long. On the other hand, my reaction focused more on the characters than the author, so Boutler did a good job at keeping me in the story in spite of it.Personally, I'd like to see Mr. Boulter upgrade this cover. I feel funny saying it, given that I used this same graphic on one of my own early works. I find the typography off-putting and somewhat illegible, and the shape of it sets it apart from other ""books"" because it's too square. If I hadn't been intrigued by the story because of a forum conversation with Mr. Boutler, I would have given this one a pass based on cover alone and *that* would have been a mistake on my part. I'd hate to see others miss out on a really good yarn because they couldn't get past the cover art.If you like Linnea Sinclair or Catharine Asaro, you'll like the romance aspect. If you're a fan of Lee and Miller's Liadan Universe, the world building here will appeal to you.

What are the mysteries lurking in the secret passageways of the manor, and why so much grief and guilt in the eyes of those who live In the Manor of the Ghost?When Devlin Clayborne arranges to have Kaitlyn Dupree marry him, he has no intention of personal interaction with his beautiful, loving bride. Instead, he writes a business arrangement wherein she serves as ""mother"" to his child, and in turn, she becomes lady of the manor. Her reputation for kindness and her love for his son precedes her, and when she comes to stay, he does not account for the way her compassion and tenderness affect him. But will it be enough to dispell the shroud of gloom from the home, or from his soul?Kaitlyn comes to the Manor with reluctance. The master of Clayborne Manor gives her the creeps. She has heard the ugly rumors about him, and she wants no part of him until her brother-in-law talks her into accepting the contract. She loves his son, but she also feels responsible for the womens shelter from which he threatens to withhold funding if she does not agree to wed.

I felt the return of that same enjoyment recently while reading Tina Pinson's inspirational gothic ""In the Manor of the Ghost"" (Desert Breeze Publishing, 2010).Inspirational gothic? Yep; it's another new frontier for inspirational fiction (similar to regency romance) and Ms. Pinson explores it deftly in this book.In this story, Kaitlin Dupree is a young woman acquainted with tragedy and loss who finds herself marrying the mysterious Mr. Clayborne as a matter of expedience and compassion for his troubled young son. Of course, true to classic gothic style, the new bride of the manor finds Devlin Clayborne to be a man with secrets in his past, and he is surrounded in his mansion by strange people and even stranger goings-on.In a sort of reversed fashion, there's a certain Jane Eyre-esque element to the story as well.But unlike most traditional gothics, Ms. Pinson's novel also deals with elements of faith, repentence, forgiveness, and compassion spurred on by the promptings of the Holy Spirit in an individual's life.There was a unique setting to the book. While most gothics traditionally take place in locations such as the English countryside, southern bayous, or in old Bostonian homes, the Ghost's manor is located in 1800s Minnesota near the twin cities. At first I had a hard time accepting that setting, but Tina does a fine job of helping me suspend my disbelief, just as every fiction writer must.Sometimes the prose felt a little bit flowery too, but that also ended up lending to the ambience of mystery and danger she infused into the story. It had a strong, drawing-in effect.Overall, In the Manor of the Ghost is a pleasant read that drew me in with full-bodied characters and mysteries to solve on several levels. Who is the mysterious ghost? What horrible memories rack the mind of the young child who refuses to speak? Why is his father, the dark and handsome Devlin so tormented? And will the lovely young Kaitlyn be able to overcome the sad memories of her own past and the prejudices of those around her, and be able to love a man who seems determined to push her away?The answers lurk in the manor of the ghost -- waiting to be drawn out.","Naomi D.

Many of my nights are spent with the ever popular Victoria Holt so picking up Tina Pinsons Manor of the Ghost had to be a given. Since other reviewers have already given a hint as to what the story is about I will move onto the next step. Tina did a great job of threading together just enough mystery with faith with romance and with subplotting that makes you want to keep turning the pages to see it all come together. She succeeded beautifully. A good read and well worth couple of your quiet evenings in front of a blazing fire with just enough lights turned low.,Reviews by Eryn

In this one the h definitely got left with a toothpick size stick.  (SPOILER)  She is left with a husband that IMO is not all that spectacular.  The guy hands her out without talking to her first or taking her into consideration at all.  He seems completely self-absorbed during the entire book and then doesn't even defend her when she is called a b***h.  This author is a real hit and miss for me and this one was a miss.

I am into this. Big time!!Not gonna lie . . . I just logged into Amazon and damn near bought every last book Megan Hart has ever written after reading this one. I am so impressed with her writing style, her narrative voice, her punctuation, her flawless subject/verb agreement. The confident ease with which she writes hooks me in. I love her. Megan Hart is this English Major's wet dream. That woman can write.Book 1 was an emotional roller coaster and while Book 1.5 wasn't quite the ride of Book 1 (duh, you already know the ending), it filled in some gaps for me. It cemented my theory that Jamie and Alex belong together but that circumstances such as youth, growing up, marriage, denial, and now sanctioned marital shenanigans, has kept them apart.I understand that Book #2, &#34;Naked,&#34; is where Alex finds love, but I am praying there will be Book #3 (there is definitely a Book #3 in my perfect fairy happy land) where Alex and Jamie have a chance at a HEA, so that something good can come out of all the realness that went down in Books 1 & 1.5. The two men are the real love story here. To me, Anne was just the vehicle for the two dudes to get from the &#34;Friend Zone&#34; to the &#34;Friends Who Do Other Fun Stuff in the Same Room Together Too&#34; Zone. Jamie might not be gay with other dudes, but he is madly in love with Alex and this Megan Hart Fangirl thinks they deserve a chance at happiness.This was a quick, fantastic read.

There is a little bit of a tech side to it, but not enough that it would stifle the enjoyment for those that aren't into that world. The book follows a professor who is accused of releasing the worst computer virus the world has ever seen and whose son is kidnapped on the same day. Now he is a wanted man and he is also searching; the hunted and the hunter. Unlike most books with similar theme, this one doesn't get into the realm of disbelief where a regular guy can all of a sudden do super things. Rather, when he gets hit in the head he goes down. He has never fired a gun before, he is nervous and doesn't have accuracy. He is still a real man.Spyware is a fairly simple book and a breeze to get through. It starts off a little bit slow to introduce the characters and scenario, but one the action starts it keeps going until the end. While it is semi-predictable where things are heading, there are of course a few twists to throw the reader in a different direction. Nothing groundbreaking in this book, just a fun action book that you can read without thinking too much.

She has avoided being selected thus far.  Now it's all about killing time and waiting out the one person she hopes to avoid.The Prefect of Lorahan has other plans.  He's been watching her to discover how she's avoided the selection process.  Frustration and anger make him desperate enough to use trickery to gain the knowledge he needs to make her his consort.Will Illona submit to his whims and desires?  Or will she outsmart him again and make her escape?Imperfect is a wicked commentary on a variety of subjects.  The main ingredient in this boiling cauldron of social issues is the ever raging battle of the sexes, and the warzone that is sometimes called marriage.  Illona and her mate are the means to ensuring the future of Lorahan.  I particularly enjoyed the way this couple matches wits and fighting skills--in and out of the bedroom.The story is unusual in how it tackles gender relations and the old ball and chain, which made for a zesty, humorous and insightful read.  No matter which direction the plot turned, everything stands apart from other Terran Times tales.  By the time you finish the first ten pages, you realize Illona's purpose on Lorahan is more complex than what you first presume.  She's not just some silly creature whiling away her time in a harem, waiting for the Alliance to cash her out so she can spend the rest of her days on a permanent vacation.  Nope, there's more to her rebel-without-a-cause demeanor than what's put in front.  She (and the other women) has a right to carry a chip on her shoulder after being labeled Imperfect.  Just what that entails...well, you'll have to read it for yourself.  There is a message there that is quite important on so many levels.  Whether Illona's up to the task of consort is what kept me on edge the entire time.  I'll let you decide if she succeeded, which means-drum roll-you'll have to take the plunge and read it.  For long-time fans of the series, you know this author never disappoints.  My advice to all the newcomers is it's time to catch up!

It is too hard to figure out the logistics of the storyline bt that is not so much the point: what matters is how the reader gets there, understand the characters, embrace them and experience with them their own emotions. I like the bit of postscript at the end. The characters were believable and their situation vivid.Loved ""What She Needs"" and ""Liberating Lacey"", now I want more stories by ms. Calhoun; she is a strong and intense writer. I like it!! I love it!!",Clicia Tremblay

It is well written with details and depth. It is fast paced, page turner. It has romance, sensuality, military life, breaking social barriers,hardship, and true love. Can a Viscount's daughter and an innkeeper's son break the social barrier to true love....The hero, Will is a natural born soldier, a sergeant, brave, handsome, well educated, and an innkeeper's youngest son.

21169,B003U89SIE,4,"Strong Debut, Worth Checking Out",A3FG0FQHNV2UP2,"[6, 6]","It used to be fairly common for Regency novels to deal with the wars and the soldiers on the streets. Somewhere over the last ten or twenty years those fell out of favor. You might have a returned soldier or a few dozen spies, but novels about soldiers or their wives largely ceased to exist. In The Sergeant's Lady Susanna Fraser brings those novels back to life. With a style reminiscent of Joan Wolf's early Regencies, Fraser sets her characters in the Spanish countryside for a look at a different aspect of Regency life. Anna is the sort of heiress you wouldn't expect to find following her husband's regiment around. With a net worth somewhere upwards of 6 million dollars she should be a prize to her husband. Sadly for Anna, her husband holds a flaw common to first husbands in the Regency. He's just not that into her.Will, a Sergeant with a net worth somewhere upwards of quite a bit less, is very into Anna. Unfortunately (and with welcome realism) Will is aware that he is unlikely to catch a woman of Anna's rank. Doing so could be a disaster for them both, and certainly the end of his career. Wartime being what it is, events conspire differently and soon Will and Anna find themselves unable to stay apart. The relationship between them is sweet and natural, with Anna's family's wealth being recent enough for her to relate to the 'common' people but large enough to prove a complete deterrent to Will. While the events that unfold around them occasionally go a bit over the top (Really, guy in well? That's your big plan?) overall the realism of social conflict is a welcome change from the status oblivious characters of Greater Regencyland.I was torn between three and four stars for The Sergeant's Lady. It's better than three stars, but some issues with side villains and the ultimate resolution kept it from a five star read. While I think Anna is kidding herself that she could be content without her wealth the reactions of those near to Anna and Will make for an engaging and different Regency read. Any fan of traditional Regency should certainly consider Susanna Fraser a new author to watch.",E. A. Montgomery
21170,B003U89SIE,5,"Fantastic, fresh Regency romance",AIDLVA1QYWTXU,"[1, 1]","This book is proof that even in the overdone Regency genre, it's possible to write a story that is fresh and new. I classify this as a Regency because it is set in 1811 and features English protagonists (well, actually the heroine, Anna, is Scottish, but she is considered English gentry). However, the setting is not the ballrooms and drawing rooms of Regency London, but rather Portugal/Spain during the Peninsular Wars. The second unique element to this story is that the heroine is high-born, but the hero is a lowly sergeant in the British Army, a foot soldier who is not supposed to even look at a high-born lady, let alone interact with one. Usually when there is a class difference in a Regency, one of the protagonists is in trade, or is a barrister or a doctor, or something like that. Here, the hero, Will is the son of an innkeeper who was being groomed to be a farmer until he ran away to join the army. He attended a village school and can read, but is otherwise not ""educated"".Anna, the heroine, is following the drum with her Cavalry officer husband, when he is killed. As Anna tries to make her way to Lisbon to catch a boat back to England, her convoy is attacked and she and Will, the sergeant are captured by the French. When they escape, they are thrown together, must rely on each other, and their mutual admiration quickly turns into love.Anna and Will are wonderful lead characters. Both are smart and sensitive. They know their love is forbidden and they try to fight it, but they just can't. No TSTL characters here. I was emotionally invested in both of the characters and was rooting for them to overcome the social pressures against them and find their HEA. The author clearly did her research and there are lots of solid details about Army life and the hardships it entailed. I can hardly believe this is a debut book. It is well-written, well-paced, and flows smoothly. I can't wait to read her next book.",esm4
21171,B003U89SIE,5,Great Love Story - War Time Regency Romance - Mismatched H/h,A2EROLHNRQ09CY,"[1, 1]","I've only recently been introduced to Susanna Fraser's writing and I'm happy to have found her books.  I agree that she writes about similar happenings that you might find in Carly Kelly's books but I don't agree that she has a similar writing style.  Carla Kelly is one of my favorite authors but Susanna definitely has her own unique style and I for one appreciate both of these authors' ability to write about interesting characters whose lives do not fit anyone's preconceived notion of how a romance in the 1800's must be in order for the H/h to have their HEA.In The Sergeant's Lady, Anna Arrington has been accompanying her cavalry officer husband on his tours of duty in Wellington's army for two years.  Although she thought herself in love with him at the time of their marriage, she has lived to regret her choice many times over.  When he dies, she joins a convoy of wounded men and some other ladies who are traveling back to England and from there she plans to travel to her family home in Scotland.Accompanying this convoy is the handsome, capable, Sergeant Will Atkins who has befriended Anna previously and protected her from her husband at the risk of being flogged.  To say they are attracted to one another is an understatement.  They are in the midst of a war, he is an alpha male who is kind, responsible and honorable.  She is lovely, has suffered loneliness and the man who has shown her kindness is conveniently at hand.  She also happens to be the daughter of an earl and a very wealthy heiress whereas Will's family are not gentry - they own an inn and he is an enlisted man, having served in Wellington's army for 8 years. His older brother will inherit the family inn and Will's future profession will most likely be that of a simple farmer.But during wartime, things that may not be ""meant to be"" happen nonetheless and such is the pathway of Anna and Will.  When they become separated from their convoy because of circumstances which I won't reveal, they are thrown together for a few days without any chaperones and of course their relationship becomes deeper than they intended.  Actually, Anna is so hungry for the type of companionship denied her by his husband, she is willing to throw it all to the winds.  Will tries to be the gentleman he knows he should be... well, you get it.The big question:  How will Ms. Fraser give them their HEA?  Yes, it does take some time and a few readers may not enjoy some of the frustrations and circumstances that Will and Anna must go through. I thought this story was a refreshing change from so many books in this genre.  I plan to read all her books and look forward to future writings.",Judge Tabor
21172,B003U89SIE,2,Vaguely Depressing,A2YX1QL07CL7B8,"[4, 5]","I found this vaguely depressing. If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say. I'm sorry because I would have loved to have found another author who can offer such heartwarming stories as Kelly. The many excellent reviews of this book led me to expect a very different read, and I do hope if you buy this book you will have the experience others have had, and not what I found.",Linda Jean

21175,B003U89SIE,5,Delightfully Different Regency Romance!,A195CDMU0504D1,"[6, 6]","I haven't read a Regency Romance in many years, but this is quite different from what I recall. Those novels never took place in an army encampment.Anna Arrington is an officer's wife and the niece of an Earl. Her marriage is a troubled one, as her ignorant husband makes an incorrect assumption about her on their wedding night, and he will neither be dissuaded from his misconception nor will he forgive her. Adding to their troubles is the fact that she cannot seem to conceive. And of course, he blames her. In an vain effort to help their marriage, she goes with him when he goes off to battle with Wellington's army in Spain.The novel starts when Anna defies her husband to help a camp follower named Juana give birth to a child. Juana's lover happens to be best friends with Will Atkins, a popular sergeant with the Rifles. Anna and Will find themselves working together to save the child, earning both of them Juana's everlasting gratitude and establishing an unlikely friendship between the officer's wife and the commonborn sergeant.I liked both Will and Anna. Ms. Fraser did a masterful job especially when portraying a scene from Will's point-of-view. We easily feel like we are behind his eyes. She even uses a crude term that would immediately make this an R rated review if I mentioned it. However, I cannot imagine an innkeeper's son referring to his ... maleness as anything other than his c**k. So it worked perfectly.  There were sex scenes, but I wouldn't classify them as very hot.If I had any critique, it's that some of Anna's problems were rather quickly solved. Which meant, in order to keep the plot moving, we needed no fewer than three villains. You can forget about the Regency trope where one bad-ass stalker of a villain pesters the lady until a climatic battle between the hero and the villain at the end. I do like that the plot was fresh, but I kept wondering when a certain unkilled villain was going to turn back up. Eventually, I realized that we had, indeed, seen the last of him. It's good that as a reader, I was kept guessing, but that particular plotline wasn't entirely satisfying. If any villain deserved to be killed, it was him.Once the villains were out of the way, the reader was left wondering how the heck Anna and Will were going to get back together. I loved the long delays between letters-you sure had to have a lot of patience back then! The ending was very satisfying.The Sergeant's Lady was an adventurous glimpse of a Regency period that does not include cotillion balls and tours in the country. Instead of trimming hats, Anna learns how shoot what must have been a black powder pistol. Instead of sleeping in feather beds, they must sleep in caves while on the run. And although Will rescues her plenty of time, in the end, Anna must rescue herself. I really enjoyed it, and I'll look forward to Ms. Fraser's next novel.","P. Nevitt ""Tia Nevitt"""

This book definitely does not disappoint. The characters are well fleshed out and interesting in their own right. The gradual reveal of what is really going on in the cult compound is satisfying and disturbing all at once. And when you find yourself mentally yelling at a character not to do something, you know you've been drawn in.The details of just how the cult was being controlled and the cult leader performing miracles was quite interesting and original. Granted, I don't have anywhere near enough knowledge in the field to know if it was at all researched or accurate, but it felt plausible to a layman, and that's really all it needs to be for most of us. The author does paint an excellent picture of a sociopath and how they think, when we finally get inside the cult leader's head. It's at once both disgusting and fascinating, operating with a total lack of empathy.In the beginning there's a decent amount of police procedure, and while that generally turns me off a bit I didn't find it slow or boring here.

The way the story was written made me wonder if John's developing relationship with the assigned psychologist, Marilyn Michaelsen, was his way of not falling completely under the cult's spell.

Since the main character is a homicide detective, the book has many of the qualities of a police procedural in the beginning and of a murder mystery throughout. However, what elevates the book beyond just another okay murder mystery are the story threads that make the book as a whole more of a psychological thriller.The People's Temple is an infamous cult, best known for the ""Jonestown Massacre"" in Guyana and subsequent mass suicide by many of the members. Those who are too young to remember this (it happened in 1978) might have heard the expression, ""don't drink the Kool-Aid,"" which is a pop-culture reference to that mass suicide.John Richetti, the protagonist of ""The Prophet Motive,"" was a member of The People's Temple as a child and his parents both died in Guyana. As he investigates Earthbound, the cult in this book, the similarities between the two cults provide additional motivation for John. At times, he seems to view uncovering the truth behind the suspected murders of Earthbound members as revenge for his parent's deaths, possibly causing him to become too personally involved with the case. The memories of his time with The People's Temple and the obvious parallels with Earthbound serve to ratchet up the tension.

Characters who breeze through everything make stories boring; these two are far from perfect. Throughout the book, they both make mistakes, and those mistakes come back to haunt them. As a reader, I figured they would both survive, but there was a little question in the back of my mind that next time, they would fail.Overall, that plot is captivating, though the underlying conspiracy may be a bit unrealistic. (I am not a doctor, so don't know if what is done in the book is actually possible.) But as a plot point, it was very well done and was a huge twist.This was a book that was hard to put down.","E. L.

21266,B003UBTWDM,5,Another superb suspense thriller by Eric Christopherson!,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,"[31, 37]","Note: This review was originally published at Red Adept Reviews on June 23, 2011.Overall:  5 starsPlot/Storyline:  5 starsHaving devoured two earlier novels by Eric Christopherson, I knew he could crank out superb suspense thrillers, so I downloaded The Prophet Motive, expecting another good one. The Prophet Motive did not have quite the heart-pounding suspense of Frame-Up or the intense mystery of Crack-Up, but it was very close.The story involved a cult called ""Earthbound,"" which was one of those ""save the earth"" groups. The leader, L. Rob Piper, was known to his followers as ""The Wizard,"" due to his apparently supernatural powers. After the suicide death of a former Earthbound member, San Francisco cop John Richetti and police psychologist Marilyn Michaelsen infiltrated the cult to find out what was going on.The first couple of pages hooked me, as a good crime story should. From there, the suspense ratcheted up as Richetti and Michaelsen gradually learned about the cult and its operations, and built a criminal case against its leader. They were in danger of being found out, but the bigger danger was being brainwashed by the cult's very effective indoctrination and mind control methods.The story had some fascinating enactments of the mind control techniques that many cults use to recruit members and gain their unconditional loyalty to the cult and its leader. In addition, The Wizard used neural implants to control members' behavior. Some of the neuro-technology sounded like science fiction, but I looked it up, and it's based on fact. Scary stuff, since it can be used for both good and evil purposes.Characters:  5 starsJohn Richetti and Marilyn Michaelsen were good characters. They weren't naturally attracted to each other, but the potential for romance was always there. Richetti and his parents had been members of Jim Jones' Peoples Temple, and the nightmare memories of that experience motivated Richetti to bring down The Wizard before another Jonestown-like mass suicide could occur.L. Rob Piper, aka The Wizard, was - as many cult leaders are - highly charismatic, with powers that appeared to be supernatural. Richetti and Michaelson knew they would have to resist his Svengali-like attraction, or their undercover mission was doomed to fail. Piper invoked memories of the infamous Jim Jones, but he had developed advanced mind control techniques that Jones could only dream of.Writing style:  5 starsThe author knows how to write a fast-paced, suspenseful crime drama. Richetti and Michaelson were always on the verge of being exposed as cops, but their steady nerves held, even after it became clear that The Wizard was more than just an environmental zealot, and that he would stop at nothing to preserve his kingdom.The vivid flashbacks of Richetti's life as a child in the Peoples Temple compound in Guyana were very effective in building a growing sense of horror at where the story could go.Christopherson's writing was descriptive without being overly verbose, and dialogues were realistic. There were a few scenes that were quite violent.Editing:  4 3/4 starsI found only a handful of typos and grammatical errors, and the Kindle formatting was very good.The Prophet Motive is novel-length with 7,808 Kindle locations, which included excerpts from the author's other novels Frame-Up and Crack-Up.",J.

The writer does an absolute fabulous job at bringing the cult mentality, the criminal aspect of the cult and the struggles of law enforcement to invade the cults to life.  The criminal enterprise of this cult is staggering and while I don't doubt for a minute that it's doable, it's so farfetched yet so easy to see how someone would go through such lengths to protect an empire they have built.

I look for engaging characters, natural dialog, well-paced and intriguing plot, enough background and setting but not too much boring detail.""The Prophet Motive"" fulfilled all those criteria quite well, better than average.  It had the ring of authenticity when it concerned cults and cult leaders; no so much for other factors, such as the way police and FBI make decisions.Dialog and description were clunky at times and I remember one vignette that stopped me in my tracks.  Bad Guy mounted on horseback.  Good Guy (I'm trying hard not to make it a spoiler here) on foot.  Bad Guy intends to capture or injure Good Guy.  Good Guy walks up to the horse, uncinches the saddle so that Bad Guy falls off, vaults onto horse and rides off bareback.  Oh, really?  Pleeze...and no earlier discussion of Good Guy had given any hint of that person's equestrian experience.  Hmmm....Inspector's reinstatement was miraculously fast, practically overnight.  I don't think so.  Estranged wife introduced, child has a problem in school, never heard from again.  ""...as nervous as a hummingbird cleaning hippo teeth"" and ""He felt as giddy as the morning sun outside his breakfast nook,"" similes worthy of a high school writing assignment.So it's a 4 rating, instead of a 5.

21292,B003UBTWDM,2,Genteel readers might want to sit this one out,A3D7TM8VOENZHX,"[71, 77]","After serious contemplation, my opinion is that sensitive readers may want to take a pass on this uneven and, in places, somewhat unpleasant book.Part of the problem is the subject matter, part is the uneven writing, and part is the character of Homicide Inspector John Richetti, a highly-stressed hard-drinking policeman who was caught up in the Jonestown cult as a child in the `70s -- the one where 900 people drank the Kool-Aid.At times, Richetti is so dimwitted and irresponsible that even his undercover partner calls him a ""stupid bastard."" Here's one example: He gives seven sleeping pills -- seven! -- to a cult member not used to taking them (this isn't a bad guy) and the person almost doesn't wake up. Here's another: Despite being specifically warned not to tell the truth because admitting personal weaknesses lets the cult get their hooks into you, he openly admits his involvement at Jamestown. He always knows best and he's always wrong.In fact, neither of the investigators, Richetti or Marilyn Michaelsen, the police department psychologist who accompanies him under cover, is up to the task -- the supremely dangerous job of infiltrating the Earthbound cult and bringing two suspected murderers to justice. But at least Michaelsen has some brains and self control. Richetti is a fool.But here's the crux of it.If you're touchy about abusive situations involving children or violent rape or coercive acts involving feces (I'm sorry, there's just no oblique way to say it), you should really consider giving this book a wide berth. At the part about forced coprophagia about two-thirds of the way in -- hey, you're going to have to look it up, I'm not defining it -- I almost put the book down in disgust. And at the end, I'm not so sure I shouldn't have stopped there. Your tolerance for this kind of writing may vary, of course.","S. Emoto ""semoto"""

However, I could not finish the book, it was just too creepy - instead of looking forward to the next plot development I just felt dread at what awful thing was going to happen, probably to some woman, next.

More than 30 years later, he's investigating the strange suicide of a woman who appears to be connected to a cult named Earthbound.  Richetti's ""partner"" is police psychologist and cult expert Marilyn Michaelsen. Together, they infiltrate Earthbound and meet the charismatic and enigmatic leader, L. Ron Piper.The author obviously put in more than a little research into cult dynamics, which gave this book enough authenticity to be uncomfortably realistic. As John and Marilyn are initiated into the cult, they undergo a series of challenges designed to brainwash them into obedience and submissiveness. Despite their mission to infiltrate and uncover the truth behind the cult, both of them become compromised as they are deprived of sleep and forced into altered states of consciousness, their defenses broken down. It soon becomes apparent that L. Ron Piper may have the upper hand in this cat-and-mouse thriller.The character development of Richetti, Michaelson and Piper was excellent. Even better was the description of Earthbound. Have you ever wondered how a thousand innocent souls could have voluntarily ended their lives at the People's Temple? This book does an outstanding job of telling us what goes on behind the scenes, what motivates people to join cults and believe in them to the point of their unhesitating willingness to die at the whim of their leader.This book was written very professionally and well edited, with almost no typos or grammatical errors.

21556,B003UNLJZE,4,A Story for Everyone,A21FGA1Z7PI4YA,"[1, 1]","While just seven stories, I took a week to read this short collection. Why? Because each tale is so well-done, poignant, scary, touching, chilling, and moving that I had to let each one settle into my head, thinking about the themes, the characters, the situations, and tightly wound narratives. Each short tale is very different yet no less compelling than the last.Some stories will leave you bewildered and baffled, others will frighten you, and still others will move you emotionally. You'll find everything from a straight-up ghost story, a reimagining of 9/11, and a TWILIGHT ZONE take on telephonic communication with the dead. But the overarching themes that tie these stories together nicely is how people deal with loss, betrayal, and family.Fans of ""quiet horror"" will love this little collection, and I recommend they check out Freeman's other books for more of the same wonderful storytelling--THE PAINTED DARKNESS and BLACK FIRE (as James Kidman).",David M.

21557,B003UNLJZE,4,More please...,AB0YA9ZGRERO4,"[1, 1]","Brian is something of a rarity in today's Horror genre. A writer who doesn't beat you over the head with all the violent, gory details in his stories. Oh, the violence and gore is there, but it's left to your imagination. Kind of like the shower scene in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". You may not see every stroke on the screen, but you certainly visualize it in your mind. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a place in Horror for the writer who put's it all on the page, but it's nice to see one with the skill to achieve the same results with the unwritten word. On to ""Seven Stories"". If I have any complaint it's that 7 wasn't enough. It was a little like your favorite band releasing an EP rather than a full album. The collection started with ""Walking With the Ghosts of Pier 13"" It's not straight out of today's headlines...yet. And I'm hopeful that events like these never come to pass here in the US. In all his stories, Brian finds the horror in the everyday, often dealing with loss, shining a light into the darness only to reveal a deeper darkness. I love Brian's ability to make me cringe and squirm just by setting the table and allowing me to imagine the torment and horror of a situation, as he does to perfection in ""The Punishment Room"". It all wraps up with a shocking ending in story seven, ""When the Sunlight Sleeps"".

All previously published, Brian James Freeman and Cemetery Dance offer up this relatively modest collection, and given how much I enjoyed his novella,The Painted Darkness, I didn't hesitate adding this to my Kindle.While a couple of the stories are truly horrific on a visceral level, the majority of this collection follows a quieter path in scaring the reader. ""Walking with the Ghosts of Pier 13"" is a strong example of the latter, as a man wanders a boardwalk amusement park in the wake of terrorist attacks across the country that have devastated the nation's psyche and targeted amusement parks specifically. It's more of a look at the aftermath than the act itself, but all the more disturbing because of it.Stories like ""Running Rain"" and ""The Punishment Room"" offer some unsettling twists on familiar ideas, serial killers with the former and torture and justice with the latter. Both were two stand-outs among seven very strong offerings. If there's a runt in the litter, it might be ""What They Left Behind,"" which I thought had a great creature feature vibe as a couple office workers explore the dessicated warehouse of where they work. Good, but forgettable compared to my favorite of the bunch, ""Where Sunlight Sleeps."" That story, which tugs the ol' heartstrings with a tale of a father taking his son on their weekly tour of his dead wife's mundane travels, at the behest of a grief counselor to help the son cope with her death. Really touching and really disquieting as it goes along.This collection is relatively small compared to the more conventional books you see on shelves, but as an e-book it's a very convenient size for curious readers that would like to take Freeman's writing for a test drive.

21587,B003URRNR8,4,Powerful Story of Animal Cruelty,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,"[0, 0]","One of the most shocking true examples of animal cruelty forms the basis of ""Noose,"" a powerful, sad short story by Ernie Lindsey. In rural Tennessee in 1916, a circus elephant killed a trainer who had probably been mistreating the animal. The circus owner then staged a public execution of the elephant, witnessed by thousands of people, in which the elephant was hanged using a construction crane.That much is fact, and, if Lindsey had merely written an article describing the events, it would have been a good piece. However, he has done much more. The execution of the elephant is only the backdrop for a coming-of-age story involving Roy, a teenage farmhand with a love of animals and another type of love for Emily, his boss's daughter. Roy learns a lot about human nature, from the reactions of his own family and those attending the execution, most of whom believe they are actually handing out justice to a malevolent creature. Roy's own feelings are far more complex, and he grows up a lot over the course of a few days.In a story that's less than 20 pages, Lindsey does a great job of showcasing the nature and feelings of the local populace, and his description of the events surrounding the actual execution are harrowing. This is a masterful short story, that works both as a depiction of a sad historic episode and an exploration of a young man's character.My only caveat with this story is the cost and the length of the story. I got the book for free as a promotion and on the basis of its literary quality, it would easily rate five stars. However, the story apparently sells for a dollar normally, and I question whether there's enough value in a story that can be read in ten minutes to justify the cost. In fairness, I question paying the money for this one story, so I deducted a star for that. If, however, you are willing to pay a dollar for an excellent 15-page short story, then I wholeheartedly recommend ""Noose.""",Silver Screen Videos

If I had I would have realized that this said it was only the first two chapters of the book, and not the whole book, or a whole short story, novella, whatever.  Fortunately I realized it before I wrote the review or my review would have definitely been different.The first two chapters of The Hungry are extremely fast paced. There is no down time for pleasantries for Penny, Deputy Wells, Scratch and Needles. It really pulled me along and I have to say I was definitely disappointed when I ran out of pages. Also, there's at least one twist that I didn't see coming.Even though it is only the first two chapters I did start to get a feel of what Penny is about.  There wasn't any real background given on her, but she made some decisions that showed exactly which way her moral compass points. She also is very self assured and doesn't break easily.If the first two chapters are any example of the rest of the book, it looks like it will be quite an interesting ride.

(And I'd like to think it would be a little more difficult to exterminate the U.S. Army)But it has it all; intense - nail-biting action, military research, and compelling, intriguing characters - definitely beyond the reach of an 'over-heated fifteen year old'.

I got to the point that I could see the formula and tell if the character was going to live or die shortly by the degree of development and attention he/she received and as a result I didn't really invest too much into the second tier players.I'm not suggesting it should have been a space opera.

23058,B003XRE5LM,5,4.5 out of 5,A1404LLHJYCX25,"[20, 20]","Rating: 4.5 out of 5There is something to be said for the slam-bang horror tale.  You know the type - they drag you in, shake you around a bit, and then pull away, never once telling you why everything that happened, happened.While reading ""Down the Drain"", a fast-paced novelette by Daniel Pyle, I was struck at first by how strange and audacious the storytelling was.  Hell, the first chapter is told through the viewpoint of a cat!  From there, it moves onto the main character, Bruce, a lonely independent contractor whose bathtub seems to have a thing for cat-flesh and penises.  Short story even shorter, Bruce is accosted one night while bathing, the accursed tub doing things to him that might not be printable on a family blog before giving birth to something even stranger than a living, breathing hunk of porcelain.This is a very straight-forward, action-driven tale.  And it's also fun.  The scares are there, and the creepiness, but it's the sense of humor - and the desire to shock you - that shines.  I laughed out loud and cringed at the same time while I read it - especially during a scene involving a waggling phallus and the contemplation of how far away is a safe enough distance from a man-eating bathtub.Never once is a reason given for the bathtub's actions, and that's okay.  Sometimes, you can be given a larger chill by not knowing than if the author were to give you an unsatisfactory explanation.  I love this style of storytelling, though I'm not very good at it, myself.  Therefore, I have much more respect for those who do.""Down the Drain"" is a rumpus of uncomfortable horror.  It goes by quickly, and will grab you in places you'll never expect and jiggle you around a while.  It's an extremely enjoyable ride, no matter how short it is.  I personally guarantee fun will be had by all who read this...unless you're bothered by naked men running around and defending themselves from man-eating bathroom fixtures, that is.Plot - 9Characters - 8Voice - 10Execution - 9Personal Enjoyment - 9Overall - 45/50 (4.5/5)","JOA ""Journal of Always Reviews"""

You're still reading? Well, okay...Right up front, I have to admit that, as a child, I had a fear of showers. Part of this was having watched the movie, Psycho, at a young age. The other problem stemmed from another movie. I can't remember the name of it; all I remember was a scene where a woman was in a shower and attacked by worms that burrowed...Ugh...never mind.  I don't even want to type it. I finally outgrew my fear,well, at least until I read this novelette. It instilled some completely new fears.Although it was short, I found it to be satisfactory in encompassing a full plot. Bruce, the main character, pulled a lot of empathy, especially in how much he loved his cat. There was just something about the scenes where a grown man is calling, ""Kitty, kitty"" that really got to me. In this novellette, Bruce was more developed than many main characters in full-length novels.One thing that I really loved about this story was that the main character didn't do anything stupid. The violence happened so abruptly and was so intense that he didn't really have time for that, anyway. He was too busy trying to survive.The culminating scene was fast and furious. I don't mean ""short,"" though. It kept on for awhile, but it held my attention until the bitter end.  Like many a horror short, this one didn't have a great explanation of the danger the main character endured. As a matter of fact, the ending ""wrap-up"" was almost humorous. However, I was glad of that, since I enjoy taking showers and really didn't want to end with being terrified of mine.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe ease in which this story drew me in speaks highly of the flair and smartness of this Mr. Pyle's style. There was no dialogue to speak of, so I can't go into that. The descriptions showed a mastery of storytelling as they depicted every scene vividly. The action was well sequenced with no confusion. No mean feat when the action involved a killer bathtub.",Lynn McNamee
23062,B003XRE5LM,3,Not Since PSYCHO Have Showers Been This Scary,AYBV4RTF7ZCG8,"[5, 6]","With the pile of books that I have waiting in the wings, it's rare that I ""borrow"" books from people, and when people recommend books, I usually make a note of it and maybe I'll get to it, maybe I won't. Daniel Pyle's Down the Drain came recommended to me by a friend, and at first I was going to pass it by, but then I saw it was a small file (yes, I read it on the Kindle), and therefore knew it would be a quick read. I never expected to become so engrossed with it that I wouldn't want to put it down. I will note, however, that after the first chapter, I almost did put it down. I'll get to that later.When Bruce's cat disappears, he's more than just a little upset. The cat has been a part of his family for over ten years and his only real friend since his girlfriend walked out. She's nowhere in the house, and the only thing he can think of that might explain her disappearance is that she had somehow managed to sneak out and she was lying dead in a ditch somewhere. Never in his wildest dreams would he guess the truth of what happened to his feline companion. But he's about to find out. It seems there's something living under Bruce's house. Well, that's not exactly right. There's something living in the plumbing, something that surfaces through the drain in the shower. There's really not much more I can say without giving too much away, but suffice it to say, there is a showdown. Who wins? You'll just have to pick it up to see.I was kind of puzzled initially when I started reading Down the Drain, figuring I was going to be reading the story from the thing's point of view, but it didn't take long to realize that the first chapter is written from the POV of a cat. So we, the reader, know exactly what happened to Bruce's favorite feline. And this is where I almost put the book down. You see, I'm a sucker for animals. Yes, I love me some horror fiction, and you can maim, mutilate, butcher, cannibalize, and torture as many people as you want and it doesn't bother me (yes, I'm sick, I know it), but pleasepleaseplease leave the animals alone. Kill off an animal and you run the risk of losing me as a reader. That's just the way I am. BUT I persevered with this one. Why? It was short. I finished it in about an hour, hour and a half tops. And because my friend said she had really liked it.Once I got past the kitty killing, I admit I enjoyed Down the Drain. The central (only) character is likable enough, and the creature, as far-fetched as it was, was interestingly original. I did find it a tad predictable, but I pushed on hoping to find out more about the origins of the creature. Yes, it was what I thought it was, but I wanted to know HOW it came into being. Unfortunately, that is never explained. It was well written and well plotted, and with an ending that leaves it wide open for a sequel. Pyle is an author I will definitely be reading more of--provided he stops killing defenseless animals in stories. If you have an hour or two to kill, I would definitely recommend checking this one out. You might question the rating of three stars if I highly recommend this one.  It deserves four stars, but I feel compelled to deduct a star for the kitty.","M. J. Evans ""rabidwoof"""

Secondly, I dislike the author's fascination with the juvenile use of sex in this story; I mean really...two jerk (blank) sessions in one very short story accompanied by ongoing graphic references concerning semen and its various characteristics are a little much, don't you think???

The author had similar thoughts and acted on them. This long short story, perhaps novelette territory word-wise, moves rapidly and clocks in with a fast six chapters. It begins with a man named Bruce, with a thirsty cat searching for water and running into the thing down the drain. I felt like a bath with not enough bubbles after not learning enough about what makes Bruce tick. For example, why didn't he take better care of his cat and make sure it had plenty of fresh water?The monster is also too mysterious including its origins, motivations (hunger?) and why, if it's been there awhile, did it choose *today* to make its move? I'm not the kind of reader who has to have all the answers, but the more I'm given, the more I tend to care about the characters and the story.

I liked Vere. He would have been interesting to get to know, but sadly, we did not get to in this book.

I found myself tearing up by the second page, but that's me.Jeremy is a ghost who is haunting a mansion that Stacy was hired to appraise the valuable collection of books within its library. Jeremy has been dead for seven years and Stacy is the first person he really felt connected to, and he's extremely lonely and just wishes that Stacy could hear him, talk to him.Something happens to Stacy and afterwards she is able to see and hear Jeremy, much to his shock. Stacy feels as though she knows him, though they'd never met before. She doesn't even realize that he is a ghost at first. It takes an act of violence against her along with her will to live and Jeremy's will to keep her alive, even though he thinks they could be together in death, to bring Jeremy and Stacy closer together.I think what touched my heart the most about this story was the loneliness that Jeremy felt all those years after his death. He loved having Stacy visit each day, talking to herself, asking questions out loud that Jeremy would respond to in order to feel as though she were talking to him, making him feel less alone.

This book has all those and more.This story is well written, spine tingling at times, and the characters, from what I have heard of the south, are highly believable. People come together there to help Wolf, Jenna and Kayla. There is a sense of community that is absent in many northern states.'Retired' cop Parrick Wolf is living off the beaten path in a house he built with his own two hands. This is what helped him heal from two incidents that happened while he was working the force that left him emotionally distressed. He is back with his long time girlfriend Jenna. Jenna's daughter Kayla does not like Wolf much at all though.Cusp is a criminal who used to be a cop and Wolf's partner. Wolf caught him shooting a 'perp' rather than wait for the courts to deal with him. Wolf turned him in and they arrested Cusp. Cusp has never forgotten what Wolf did. It cost him his daughter and that he can't forgive. Cusp escapes from jail and vows to seek revenge on Wolf.As a snow storm of all snow storms descends on the sleep town of Alder Springs, we find Cusp already there and intent on his target. Wolf must protect Jenna and Kayla as well as deal with Cusp.What Wolf, Jenna and Kayla, along with some important city people, go through to catch Cusp makes for an intriguing and suspence filled read.I recommend this book highly. For those of you who worry about sex scenes, there are none to speak of. For those who worry about violence, yes, people get shot. I doubt these shootings are such that would make anyone not want to buy this book.","Dorothy ""DottieH"""

The people of the nearby town know him and give him his space. He has no problem spending time alone just walking around his land. He is happy with his life.Then he learns of a prison break across the state and quickly realizes his past will be coming back to hunt him down. He helped put his partner, a dirty cop, behind bars and at the trial told Wolf he would be coming after him. Kevin Cusp is on a mission to kill Patrick Wolf and nothing is going to stop him, not even a freak blizzard.Dollycas's ThoughtsThis is a whole new side to Tim Myers and I LIKE IT!!This is definitely NOT the cozy mystery Myers is known for. This is a smart, edgy, suspenseful story with well developed characters. Myers experience shines in writing characters that both women and men will enjoy. The rekindled relationship between Jenna and Wolf has you rooting for them to be together and Jenna's secret adds to the mix. The warped mind of Cusp is exactly what every good suspense novel needs, the perfect antagonist. Then there's the chase and the snow and the mystery of how these former partners will come together for their showdown.

It takes place in England which for someone like me that lives in the USA, makes it interesting. Though I couldn't relate with many of the places it didn't take away from the story. The way that Mr Glenn describes everything, I could close and my eyes and be right in the scene.I am however having a hard time reviewing this particular book. The writing is thorough and complete, the idea is genuine, the content is magnificent, my challenge is putting what I feel into words. There are many authors that try to pull this kind of tale off and never quite make it. Mr Glenn is not one of them. He has delivered an amazing story rich with a full range of emotions and situations that grab hold and don't let go.

Readers of more emotional works will enjoy this also, although it might take you a bit longer to come to grips with it. This is a book that works on two levels (more, but for purposes of review, two), one being the detail that goes with war and destruction both technological and biological and, two, the intense characterization which evokes an emotional response. This is ultimately a story about survival, about starting over, and to get there the reader needs understand how it happened and why all has changed.I won&#8217;t mince words: I did find it hard at first. I am an emotional reader, so to speak, and thus were the initial chapters too much of &#8216; back-story&#8217; for me, but I promise you what comes next is well worth the effort of staying with it, although you need be a &#8216;tough cookie&#8217; to handle it! And, the cherry on top, those of you who enjoy the war and destruction detail initially, will also be intrigued by what comes next.No spoilers, but expect fallen roads, abandoned hotels and a host of other buildings, bands of soldiers and worse (crazies!), and expect hardship and tribulation as well as brotherhood. And a few epic battles! The author has a &#8216;no frills&#8217; style and it works well for a story that deals with the absolute loss of the frills civilization as we know it brings.

To have one set in the North East of England near where I live? You have me ""hook, line, sinker and copy of Angling Times"" to quote the writers of Red Dwarf.Now you can't be hyper critical with this kind of tale. It's very much an overdone genre and almost anything you write will have to cross a few clich&eacute;s. It's just the way the genre is. That never stopped any of those folk writing the bloody awful romantic vampire tales now did it? So having taken that on board I sat down to enjoy the novel.Having read some of Rod Glenn's work before I knew that I would more than likely enjoy the read. I wasn't wrong. Rod's fast and pacy style doesn't so much lead you as drag you along by the scruff of the neck. The initial scenes deal with the release of a virus that leads to the breakdown of society as we know. Fast forward twenty years on and we see a very small community of ordinary folk trying to carry on as normally as possible. Well I won't put any spoilers in this review but as you might expect things don't remain idyllic for very long.Tragic events soon lead to five young friends having to journey to the mysterious Black City or Middlesbrough as we know it. Not only is this an adventure tale but also a coming of age tale as the author charts the destinies of the friends. With strong adult language and themes throughout this is a tale for the older reader. Whilst there are bloody events and scenes of a gratuitous nature I don't believe these are over done as some reviewers suggest. With a city full of warring factions and sub-human ""crazies"" you have to expect a little blood and guts don't you?A cracking read that I would recommend particularly for fans of the genre.",Grooydaz39

This is a book about, of course, an apocalyptic event, which was caused by scientific experiments run amok. The beginning of the book in military mumbo jumbo which I quickly forgot. The story and the characters are what I really enjoyed. There are several that stand out, a scene with a little girl and her dog, a young mentally challenged boy and his friend, families,etc. This book was a little different than others about the apocalypse, this book starts at the beginning and skips 20 years into the future. You get to see where they are now as a society and as people. How they are living, what has changed. There is government interference as they still try to fix what they did, but as usual, make things worse. Friends who may or may not be friends. Inner struggles and the struggle to not only survive, but to continue the human race and have a decent life. All of this and much much more are in this book. I love these kind of books and always wonder what it would really be like. I think it might go something like this. Hunting, fishing and gardening for food. A veterinarian as your doctor, growing your own tobacco, etc. The things people can learn to do when they have to, is foremost in this adventure. Very interesting characters and a variety of them.

Glenn sets up an interesting scenario at the beginning, and it's obvious that a lot of research went into creating a plausible story. However, In spite of that ambitious effort, I think it would have strengthened the story to summarize the disaster and invest more time following the individual survivors.This is a gritty, bloody tale that looks at characters linked together by family, friendship and circumstance; fighting to make their way in the bleak aftermath of a worldwide disaster brought on by war.When the thin veneer of civilization is stripped away, the world sees who we really are.

It wasn't until we meet Professor Andrew Hawthorne and his wife Annie that I slowed down and started to enjoy the story.There were several scenes in this book that I found difficult to read, emotionally. I guess that means the authors did their job well - I cared about the characters. I found it interesting to read about how these people managed to exist in this apocalyptic society. It was at times confusing but given the situation, it was expected.For some reason I thought this was going to be a zombie book, which I enjoy, but it wasn't.

There are times in which it feels very disjointed, going from a crisis in one part of the world and explaining the different ranks to another part of the world and explaining what wipes out the majority of humanity. But that was the first part, and the second half of the book gave me a far different feeling.The second section I felt was more personal and I was able to get know the characters much better, and the raw emotion I felt seemed to coincide with how I felt they would feel. In many ways I was there during the darkest moments and their slight glimmers of hope. When The Killing Moon hit its stride it was a story I had to find excuses to slink away and finish the book. I just felt so much of its power surging through my veins in the later half.I am a sucker for Apocalypse stories and after getting through the first few chapters, everything rolled along very beautifully.

The first few chapters are chaos and carnage. At first it's disconcerting until I realized it's a working metaphor for the global mentality and the sheer scale of disorder and tragedy.Despite the first few chapters starting slowly, giving the reader no indication of what's coming, you are falsely lulled into a pocket of safety in an isolated haven in a world turned black. At some points the atmosphere is so bleak and despairing you find yourself struggling to see the point to it all, but hold tight because just around the bend the book suddenly launches into dramatic action, personal (and grueling) hardships, and you have the rug pulled out from under you.By the time I hit chapter ten I for one couldn't put this book down. I read voraciously, devouring this novel. The pace is hectic, the twists and turns piling up like a car crash, and I absolutely loved some characters who totally gave the second half of the book a distinct anchor of humanity. The contrast is probably needed to appreciate these seasoned warriors willing to fight for their corner of the planet despite the sheer amount of savagery gripping the world.The writing is fantastic! I loved the descriptions, I loved the overall atmosphere, I found myself solidly 'inside' every scene, and the plot unfolded in a blur as I sped through to the end. All the pace missing from the beginning grabs you by the throat and hauls you behind the carnage in the second half and you barely have time to catch your breath. I was so invested in the outcome and so was very happy with the ending, I sagged in relief and thought 'thank heavens for that!'What a ride!! This is like Animal Farm, just better! And if you are a fan of war stories you will love the details in this book which give us constant intel on strategy, equipment, and lots and lots of things that go boom.

Multiple organizations want Eve, and the protagonist's goal is to avoid any of them getting her. Unofficial ties between the organizations add complexity and dimension to the basic plot.What makes the story unique is the development of the relationship between Sabrina and Eve along with the way Eve changes, becoming ""more human,"" as the story progresses. Imagine trying to understand why someone reacts to the world the way they do if you have no understanding of emotions and don't experience them yourself. Put yourself in the place of Sabrina's boyfriend Mark who suddenly has a person who looks like his girlfriend and shares all her memories. How would you react when you realize this interloper knows the details of all the intimate experiences you and your girlfriend have shared?This book could have used another round of proofing before publication. The issues I saw are all minor, using the word ""suite"" instead of ""suit"" or ""marshall"" instead of ""martial"" are two examples I found twice each. Although I found many of these type errors, well over the threshold where I assume it won't impact the reading experience, for me the kinds of errors and frequency were not so bad as to continually jolt me out of the story and had minimal impact on my reading enjoyment.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog.**",BigAl

The book is a cleverly written romantic comedy that can be endearingly funny at times, and poignant in others. And it is perhaps the best contemporary women's fiction I have read recently.At the heart of `Next Time Lucky' is Cherie--a professional matchmaker in her forties who, irony of ironies, seems unable to find the right man for herself. And like many modern ""singletons"", she resorts to the most common and pervasive available to those looking for love: the Internet. But as it turns out, like most information you get from a search engine, most candidates turn out to be ""garbage"", and Cherie has to sift through numbers of them until she finds the right one. What ensues is one of the most endearing tales of romantic adventure you've ever encountered.Buckley's book is very interesting because, as the author says in her disclosure, she actually is a professional matchmaker, and her years of wisdom find expression in the priceless relationship adice that sporadically appears in little scenes in this semi-fictional book--in essence, you get a novel AND a dating guide in one.But most importantly, `Next Time Lucky' has heart--and lots of it. Buckley writes with that rare emotional gravitas that can fully reel you in and feel the main character's personal dilemma. This is most evident even in the first few pages, when Cherie--only wanting what any other woman wants--is instead served with a sudden rejection, dumped by his boyfriend of three years for the shallowest of reasons. If you're not moved by Cherie's internal monologue, her cascade of regret and self-blame in her mind, than I don't know what would.I love `Next Time Lucky' to shreds--it has all the qualities of a memorable literary bestseller, and one that may very well be optioned for the movies. Fans of the genre will deeply delight in Cherie's misadventures, and will be enlightened with the author's expert advice on dating--truly, this is both an entertaining and instructive read that is worth much more than its price tag. Order a copy of this today, or send this to a gift to a friend--either way, you'll have a blast. Highly recommended!",Meghan

This is a story is about a charming woman starting another phase in her life's journey. She is divorce and has to start over with her high school son. In her loveless marriage she sacrificed her selfhood and gave into her domineering husband and moved from the elegant life, family and traditional German roots to be transplanted as a farmer in the rainy landscape of Ireland. After many years of marriage she woke up to discover her lose selfhood and realized that her children were about to fly the coop and she was not happy wanting to strike out on her own ask for a divorce. She was granted one and embarked on a strange but fulfilling destiny as an independent woman.She is a successful matchmaker and has a second career as a wine broker; all is fine except that missing element; after being alone for a while she desires to share her new found freedom and life with a partner again. Now the question; is where will she, even as Ireland's number one matchmaker find a mate. The old fashioned ways were no longer working; so enters in the modern technology of internet dating. Hesitant she decides to take the plunge and thus the story is born;It is witty and very realistic as she is experimenting with the pros and cons of meeting men from Mars; one with commitment issues, others looking for hanky panky only; others who are insecure with a professional successful woman and run away with the excuses and other colorful characters. This author is gifted in spinning words into artistic scenes of life experiencing it through Cherie as she travels to places through her main character on a mission seeking for a love and life-time partner.It is written to go across the European continents to the United States, back and forth searching for the perfect soul mate. Her descriptive mind painting of the scenery pulls the reader into the story and has the reader experiences the night air, the salty smell of the oceans, the hot sand under her feet as she is dancing to music. It is so poignant the reader is actually traveling with Cherie as she places herself into tricky situations with strangers behind the screen, being brave to see if he is the one she desires and rallying for her safety. There are lustful scenes in the story but not too graphic; hints of a women's deepest desires.

Make your own plans, Cherie. It's your life! Go where you want to go and do what you want to do. It dawned on me that I didn't need a guy to change my life around and to go where I wanted to be. I felt a sense of liberation and gave the Internet a break. Not that I was giving up on men - yet - but the day to day demands of life and hunting down Mr. Right at the same time as I was in the midst of changing the rest of my life around - Gee wizz, it took all my energy, cosmic, every day, cyber and all.""This tale is of strength and daring; to not let anything or one stop you from achieving your dreams. A It is a compelling tale with carefully drawn well-defined characters from Cherie, to her friends and the men passing in her life. This romantic thriller will pull you into the world of its heroine and inspire you to see the true power of human relationships, the pros and cons of meeting Mr. or Mrs. Right and letting your mind or heart direct your steps to the unknown mysteries of life and be free to be yourself and happy with the choices.",Susan Mahoney

It could be that she skimmed through the book as opposed to actually reading it but this was a very engaging story for me.  I agree, Melissa is annoying at times but I also find that I can identify with a lot of what her thought process is throughout the story.  She can also be a whiner but she is a girl right out of high school that doesn't think real highly of herself and a great looking mysterious man pays her attention after he saves her life.  He seems to like her and want to spend time with her and she is attracted to him.  She is also faced with some very bizarre supernatural things going on around her which would freak out most anyone.I don't want to spoil this book for others that are going to buy and enjoy it so I won't give too much away. The descriptions throughout the book are amazing.  I can see what is going on as it takes place, picturing the supernatural creatures that are a part of this book, as well as picture the people in the story.  The descriptions of the places that the story takes place are so well written that it feels as though I am going through the story with the characters.  I got a major creepy feeling with Michaels ""uncle"" and wanted to visit the ""Peach Tree Restaurant"" to see where Melissa works to see if her boss is really as annoying as he seems.  Melissa's friend Debbie is also someone that I really liked seeing how she was going to play out in the book.Personally I am excited to see how the rest of the story is going to develop, which is what happens in a series.  I don't expect all the answers in the first book but instead look forward to the next book in the series. You can't for instance read say The Two Towers and think you know everything that is going to happen in The Lord of the Rings series.  I can't wait to see what kind of new exciting supernatural creatures are introduced in the next book and to see how the relationships grow and develop.  For me this book is wavering on 4.5-5 stars.  Melissa is an annoyance but I think she is portrayed as a whiner well.  For my taste, I would have liked to see the relationship a little more physical but it works well with the way that it is written for this book making me anxious for the next book so I can see their relationship grow.",Bella Marie

If the read is rather short, easy to absorb, it is also a little disjointed. But the coverage is beautiful ...Thus, opening with a drowning and a visit to the emergency room from the heroin, I was really attached to my book. I really enjoyed myself while turning the pages. Ditto when she was followed by shadows on her way home. I enjoyed the anticipation. However, once the author presented me the monster, I began to stall. This deadly creature is not detailed enough, not enough to be described as one that should be avoid. And from this point, what had been a nice story began to annoy me.Melissa, who wanted to have a taste of independence became the shadow of Mike. Unable to stay alone, she is always whining and waiting for Mike to help her. A very immature heroine...As for Mike, the reader knows almost nothing about him. Only that he manipulates the girls and he plays with his glamour and attraction. Not necessarily a hero to whom I wish to believe in or to support.In terms of the love story between them, it is very light. Sometimes I even wondered if there was actually an attraction on Mike's part when you see how much he puts the brakes. Sure, he always has a good reason...Big disappointment also with the Twilight's references. If the first one could have been humorous, going to the theater with a vampire and compare your adventure with Bella and Edward, I thought it was a bit heavy.Yet the potential is there. I liked the idea of &#8203;&#8203;vampires, a little retro, who prefer to use tools of the century in which they died and who are skeptical of modernity. It was interesting. I also liked the start but it is as if the author had lost his concentration or if it had not been comfortable with the invention of his paranormal universe.I remain lukewarm and a little disappointed.

She had been able to remove her older sister off the streets of London, an accomplishment that made her life as a whore bearable.  Now after two years of not having to share her body in her brothel, she felt life wasn&#8217;t too shabby at all except for the dark cloud Jimmy Hyde, a scoundrel in all accounts, who held the majority share of the brothel having financed the rebuild of the brothel after a fire sustained 4 months earlier. So when he wagered Coral in a game of chance, she had to accept.  He basically owned her.  She was to spend seven nights with the winning gentleman doing whatever he requested her to do.  How could she accept to participate?  She had to, that&#8217;s all.Captain Isaac Wargate, a puritanical naval officer had come to the brothel six months previous when his ship was in harbor, not to partake himself, but to collect his junior officers so they wouldn&#8217;t get into trouble while on shore leave.  He had at that time and even now been attracted to the madam, her wit and quick intelligence, but he never dallied with women in the brothel.  How could he be this attracted to her when he never really saw her; she was always masked.The captain was standing behind the madam the night that Jimmy Hyde made the wager offering up Aphrodite herself to spend seven nights to have her do has the winner requested.  The captain saw how she reacted and knew that she was shocked and this was not by her choice that the wager was offered. The game cost way more that any normal man would wager -- one thousand guineas just to play the game of chance.  Would the captain consider wagering six-months pay to save the madam from this wager?  Or would he consider that she was a just a whore and take its consequences?Elizabeth Hoyt writes stories that read themselves!  Even though a novella, her character descriptions were fully realized .  The reader easily feels the emotions and frustration that both Coral and the captain experience along with just how they change through knowing each other.

But when Coral is threatened by the new owner of Aphrodite's Grotto, will Wargate take a chance on the woman beneath the mask...and on love?REVIEW:  Ms. Hoyt has managed to create a spell bound story which shows the path of changes, love, and desires.  I enjoyed the overall story and did find that it was a quick read - mostly due to the fact that I didn't want to put it down.  While I wished it had been a bit longer, I cherished each page that passed.Aphrodite is the supreme chided woman who has wrapped herself in a ball of protection from everything outside.  She alludes to the presence of confidence when in all actuality deep down, she's got insecurities to make any one pause.Captain Isaac is the ultimate hero who attempts to fight his feelings for this very public woman, but manages to be ensnared, not only by her beauty but deeper inside to the true woman.I liked the exchanges between these two and found that Ms. Hoyt did a great job at keeping the tension rising and showing each step they took in order to overcome obstacles.  The chapters transitioned smoothly and the writing was spot on.  The only thing I didn't like was that the ending seemed a bit rushed and out of place.  Other than that, it's a historical read I'd recommend for someone looking to get through a steamy story quick.  I give this read four out of five stars.",Deserie Comfort

24569,B003ZUY19I,4,Very well done!,A3BE1GU6WQKGB3,"[0, 0]","I thought this was cleverly done, what with the title. This is the last of the Princes Trilogy, a series of romance novels where the narrative device is the retelling of British folklore that loosely parallels the events taking place in the actual romance. The first was the Raven Prince, then the Serpent Prince, then the Leopard Prince (probably my favorite one). The final part is actually a novella, and it's about a princess - the Ice Princess. A very cute way to wrap up a great trilogy by Ms. Elizabeth Hoyt.The heroine that is our Ice Princess is Coral, a character introduced, along with her sister Pearl, in The Raven Prince. Coral is a courtesan. After a beating from one of her aristocratic protectors left her nearly dead (and badly bruised, to say the least), Coral left that life, somewhat, and became the mistress of Aphrodite's Grotto. Playing Aphrodite herself, she dons a golden mask every night and manages the general revelry, but never offers herself to the patrons.That changes one night when Jimmy, the rather sadistic majority owner of the Grotto, proposes a game of cards. Whoever wins will enjoy Aphrodite herself for seven nights. Scared and disgusted, Coral has no choice but to go along with it. Fortunately for her, Isaac Wargate is present when the scandalous game is proposed. The puritanical captain doesn't approve of the Grotto or of Aphrodite - he has a devil of a time collecting his men whenever they dock, and doesn't like that they lose so much coin and come back stumbling drunk.Seeing Aphrodite/Coral's apprehension, Isaac, who never gambles, joins in. When a bit of luck (or a slip of the hand, you decide) declares him the winner, he claims his seven nights with Aphrodite.But Isaac isn't after sex. He's after Coral. He wants to get to know her, and of course, nothing troubles this deeply suspicious, emotionally guarded young woman more. Slowly, he manages to wear down her defenses, but his seven nights are up, and so is the charade of Aphrodite.Isaac is a wonderful male lead - definitely the strong and silent type, but with a very charming soft side. He's a simple man, and a very good one. He doesn't judge Coral for her occupation and generally seeks to help her, and it's impossible not to root for him when he thinks he's lost her for good.Similarly, it's impossible not to root for Coral. She's incredibly strong considering the life she's led, but as a result is very wary of getting close to people, which is completely understandable. But Isaac offers her something she's never had before, and it's so gratifying to watch her slowly change and blossom into someone new, someone who looks at the world in a new way and doesn't just see greed and lust and misery and exploitation.This was a short but very sweet read, simple in its loveliness, just like the two main characters.",Hoomie

However, Elizabeth Hoyt has done a remarkably good job of just that in her novella ""The Ice Princess."" She picks up the character of Coral Smythe, introduced in The Raven Prince, and fills in the gaps, so to speak. But even if one is unfamiliar with the previous book, the novella is sufficient to create a poignant love story between Coral and the stern but gentle Isaac, a sea captain with an iron will and a loving heart. I'm enough of a romantic at heart to believe that in real life people can be forgiving, so Isaac's acceptance of Coral's past and his love for the woman she truly is strikes a chord of reality that is refreshing in romance novels where many times the motivations seem shallow at best and downright silly at worst. Although it is a very quick little read, I highly recommend this novella. Hoyt is one of the best in the genre and her talent here is clear.",Jeanne

I did however like that she has always found him interesting (and he her) before they finally came together due to the card game. Though I enjoyed the story very much until the ending. (Spoilers) Did Coral really have to runaway at the end? After he found her he made good points as to why she never should have left - mainly that she always wore a mask so she wasnt really going to be recognized so she shouldnt have felt they could have no future together for fear that her reputation as a prostitute would hurt him. Also i felt that after Pearl married, even though Coral would not have want to impose, that Pearl would have no longer let her live that life (though I read Pearl story, i have read so many books in between that i no longer remember it though i can say that i did enjoy Coral story better than Pearl's). After all, Coral can really live with Pearl now (especially since Coral didnt like her job) but i overlooked this for how else was she to meet the Captain but the ending could have been better. I saw no need for Coral to runaway but then again, she wouldnt be called the ice princess for nothing though i felt the Captain was able to break through her defenses fairly quickly in the short time they were together.

Not many are able to capture my attention as much as Hoyt has, especially with a novella. But Hoyt manages to do this again and again.THE ICE PRINCESS brings us readers into the bawdy houses of England and more specifically to Aphrodite's Grotto. They make a business out of sin and Coral aka Aphrodite is its queen. Forced to sell her virginity to the highest bidder to feed herself and her sister, Coral has been a prostitute since she was fourteen. Now at twenty-four, she is no longer selling her body, but men still yearn for just one touch.Men including the handsome Captain Wargate.In a move only meant to make some money, Coral finds herself the object of desire when several men bid for one week of her time. Shocked and a little scared for her safety, she holds her breath as she finds out the results. And in the end, the winner shocks her when he does something unexpected...I thoroughly enjoyed this novella. It was short, but filled with all the good things Hoyt brings to the table.

Franks was given a bad psych evaluation more than three times and forged and falsified the majority of her police application but was still hired and then showed gross inability to do the job and was retained.

Emily Rickshaw had never resolved the terror she experienced at the hands of a family friend and had instead turned the anger into rebellion. Likewise, the MacIntosh brothers had each reacted to their own tragedy in equally unhealthy ways. They need Emily to heal the damage as much as she needs them.Be prepared to have your heart strings tugged at great lengths by this poignant novella. Ms. Espino's characters are very complex and yet at the same time so very real. Emily's personal struggles and the boys heartache is so palpable at times as I reader I couldn't help but hurt for them. You know their actions are motivated by their past.Don't get me wrong this book isn't all gloom and sadness. There are some sexual encounters (both one on one and the m&eacute;nage scenes) that are smoking HOT! Holy sexual scorchers Batman! Don't forget your fire extinguisher.

She is seriously without any redeeming attributes...doesn't want to be helpful....willing to do all three brothers on the same day - not because she is interested in a menage - simply because she is apparently constantly horny.  The leap to ""love"" for the brothers and her is non-existant.  They remember a 12 year old child, and BAM - the day she returns they are in love with her.  Talk about a leap of the imagination.

If you are looking for an endearing mother daughter story, this is not the book for you.  However I must recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a tale of lifelong love.  This book is a love story told from the perspective of an innocent young woman as she goes away to college in the late 1950's and continues through-out her lifetime.I enjoyed the writers light and easy style even when managing difficult subjects and emotions.

The main character is a typical teenager at 19, the world is her oyster and she will have her cake and eat it. Then again the same goes for the self obsessed professor. There are a few scenes that are of a sexual nature,however they have not been written in an overly gratuitous way, which you often find happens nowadays to maximize and strenghen the commercial position of a book. Instead the scenes take us back to a pre 60s era, before the sexual revolution and during a time in which the people were still stuck in the conservative minefield of the 50s. The descriptions are that of an inexperienced girl and man who knows that. Other than some of the scenes perhaps being superfluous, the only thing I noticed which didn't gel with me was how the letters and the narrative sounded/read as if they were by two different people. The girl in the letters writes like a 15 year old at summer camp and the storyteller is more mature and aware of her actions.Despite the fact I think it is a 3.5 star book, because it could be better if edited down a little, I think it warrants four for making me mutter at the main character.

My goodness, where to begin? Letters to My Mother was a book I knew I had to finish the moment I finished the prologue. I read it in a day and by this last half I could barely breathe. There were so many ways it could have ended and I had no idea of how it would. I sobbed through the last 30% and I am not someone who normally cries over books, but like I said...sobbed (That doesn't mean there isn't a happy ending...or maybe it does...I'm not telling and different people will see it different ways). The writing...absolutely breathtaking at parts. Ms. Heath is an inspirational wordsmith. The topic, yes taboo. The love, absolutely, heart wrenching and unforgettable. I only read romance, typically with some erotic elements. This was emotionally erotic, but not hot, so if you are looking for graphic sex scenes, sorry. It was real. So real in its telling I wondered if it was true. I was so touched by this book on levels I liked and levels I found upsetting that I wanted to write Ms. Heath and tell her so and compliment her work, but could not find an address. I did find her bio though, where she states she didn't submit this the traditional way because she wanted to tell the story the way it was meant to be told. Now, normally I find ""explanations"" for books published the nontraditional way, but absolutely not in this case. The crime here is that this book will likely not get the recognition it deserves (I hope I'm wrong). If you ask me...it has best seller written all over it. Not because it was forced into a happily ever after, or because it didn't stray into taboo...this book leaves each reader to draw their own conclusions. I drew mine.

26097,B0041844MW,5,"A touching story, beautifully told",A1UFU1Q1KSSWIY,"[4, 4]","I have to say that I thought this book was wonderful. It is the gentle tale of two people who shouldn't be together by the normal rules of morality and the times. Kate is a young, extremely bright college student who has never had much time for boys. David is a professor at the college she attends. Brilliant but somewhat aloof, he is trapped in a loveless marriage where nobody - not even his children - can see any worth in him.  But this is Seattle in the 1950s, and nineteen year olds don't have affairs with married men in their late forties. Nobody would find that acceptable. And yet, these two find a rare love for each other.As a reader, you cannot help but begin to wonder what is going to happen. How can this end well? It is difficult to say without adding spoilers. But somehow Rebecca Heath has managed to tell this story in such a way that the sadness and the happiness mingle to just give the reader a sense of satisfaction.Each chapter begins with the brief extract of a letter from Kate to her mother - but of course, the letters don't even touch the surface of what is really happening in Kate's life. There is no way that Kate could tell her mother the truth, but somehow she manages to talk about her life without telling lies, whilst at the same time failing to mention the turbulent emotions she is experiencing.I would say this is not a romantic novel. It's a well-written true love story. For me there is a distinction. This book has none of the hallmarks of traditional romantic fiction, and doesn't attempt to put a rosy glow on life and the lovers. It's about real people, experiencing emotions that may not be right, but can't be avoided. It is a book for people who have been in love themselves, who will recognise the emotions that shine through in the writing.Rachel Abbott for the Kindle Book Review",The Kindle Book Review

I did not want to miss anything involved with the characters in the series, so I bought this book too. I was afraid this one would not have Olivia, and Grace, because it was just an &#34;extra&#34;.

However, the male species mainly shifts into half Eagle and half Bull which I find totally interesting and sexy as hell during the sex scenes, I mean come on, it excites me knowing that the pe-nis enlarges as the character shifts during the act - totally HOT!As in most fantasy worlds, a king must claim a bride for his Queen, but in this case Jakov must claim his bride (Dijana) and fill her with his seed to produce a new heir on the night of the full Red Moon that only comes around once every 100 years.I really enjoyed this fantastic read because it had futuristic elements, sexy men who were very dominant, and a priestess named Dijana with awesome powers who is definitely kickass and doesn't put up with any crap from any man.  The erotic scenes were very intriguing in the beginning and explodingly hot when the king and his advisor/brother share Dijana at the same time.  Double entry erotic scene was done perfect and will definitely have you curving your toes.The story's plot was very interesting and ends with a happy ending of love and bliss of twin babies, but at the same time leaves the story open for the second book.

Kings still rule the land. Women are still viewed as property. Magik still flows through the blood of its inhabitants. The world has a fascinating mix of historical and futuristic with a touch of fantasy and paranormal, there are shifters on this planet. I enjoyed this unique mix.Jakov has long given up on finding his destined mate. If he believes the prophecies that he lives by then she has long ago been slaughtered along with the rest of her kind. He is currently in search of a female to impregnate with an heir. He is not even slightly enthusiastic about his search until he sees his brother/advisor struggling with the next virgin.Dijana refuses to let some man take what she feels is only her right to give, her virginity. She is fuming that she has been taken from her village to be paraded before the king so that he may choose a bride. She feels that she has been reduced to nothing more than a cheapened whore.I loved Dijana! In a world where she is supposed to be overjoyed at possibly becoming the queen she is fighting to get out of the palace or wanting to fulfill her desires of killing the king. She doesn't care which. She just wants one to happen, now. She doesn't let Jakov push her around, she takes over. I loved her spirit.I had a slight problem with one of the sex scenes. I loathe sex as punishment. There was one scene that was such. The female never said no and she did not react as if she had been violated after, so that made it a little more tolerable for me. Also the fact that females are viewed as property and are punished when deemed fit made the scene mix well into the story. I just have a personal preference of disliking sex as punishment.book from the author for the purpose of an honest review","Vanessa ""The Jeep Diva"""

The author get's inside the character and makes it so you understand more of what's going on with them in their world. The events that are happening in the book(s) are less important than the effect those events have on the characters. This is what makes this book worthwhile, as well as any book for that matter. If our protagonist doesn't understand something yet, you the reader will not either until the time is right, if the time is ever right. These little things are what make the book a cut above other books of this type that I've read.The only thing wrong with the book are the things left unanswered, which is where I guess a sequel comes in.

It is still on there and recently I had the chance to re-read it.  It will be staying on my Kindle to be read again in the future.  It is that good.Young nurse, Leah Webster, is thrust into a world strange and foreign to her. Cool, remote Officer Jean MacFarlane is assigned to show her the women's prison where she will be working.  First impressions are not always what they seem, though, and Leah soon discovers that `Mac', as she is known to some of the prisoners, is a kind and fair overseer of the prisoners in her care.  The cold, stone walls of the prison have seen much tragedy, as has Officer Jean MacFarlane, but Leah's joining of the staff provides a chance at healing and change for those around her. Leah, herself, learns to see the world much differently as a result of her interaction with the personalities she meets.  While the bars and doors of an institution cannot constrain love, the social mores of the time can be crueler than any locked cell.Ms. Dax successfully captures the mood and temperament, not only of the times it covers, but also of what it was like for women in the British penal system of the 1960's.The need to be discreet in our not too distant past is made palpable by Ms. Dax's economy of words and her spot-on dialogue.  The restrictive mood of the prison and of life outside the prison was viscerally felt while reading this story.  Rachel's research into her subject matter is impeccable. Personalities come alive, and the weaving together of the storyline's threads is flawless.Romantic scenes can be difficult to write, so I've been told, but Ms. Dax handles them with just the right amount of `heat'.  The main characters' growing attraction to each other is well paced and believable.

I found myself thinking about this book throughout the day until I was able to get back to reading it after work. I had a couple of teeny issues with the story - one was that I find it incredibly hard to believe some many people within the prison setting were approving of the main characters relationship, especially during that era. Two -The ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story - it was an ok conclusion but didn't provide a real resolution to the characters problems - it only seemed to gloss them over. Now having said that, I still absolutely believe this is a 5 star book with a 5 star author - the good in the book far outweighs any negative aspects. Recommend!",codered1126

With the first half focused on the journey to Pompeii, the second half of the book flies too fast. However, it was very interesting to read about the Pompeii culture and what life would've been like back then. The love story was somewhat lacking, in my opinion. It seemed that Valerie was always staying away from Christos and when they were together there were no deep meaningful conversations that helped you to understand what exactly they were feeling. It seemed one minute they were at each other's throats and then the next they were declaring their undying love and devotion for one another.

28771,B0044KM0B4,5,Creative and original!,A1M9R7F4T0EQ3X,"[1, 1]","Brief synopsis: Alex Morgan's world is turned upside down when his office is broken into, and he stumbles upon a strange device that looks like a cell phone. Not knowing how to use the device, Alex accidentally triggers the commands that will transport him into another dimension of time where things are under complete control of the government and Nazi Britain exists.When Alex leaves his real world, he also leaves his little boy Jack behind, so desperation sets in from the very beginning. Alex must discover why this world, set in the same time period, is different. What happened that caused things to change? Along the way, Alex meets Jessica O'Neil, a freedom fighter, who stands up against the government control. Together, they set off on a journey to discover what happened in 1902 and travel back in history to try to stop it.Originality: I absolutely loved Timelapse for its originality! Ms. Farrelly wove a wonderful story that traveled into history and included figures from the time, including Theodore Roosevelt. I enjoyed the threat of the alternative history and her creation of how the future could have been changed. The new world she created, though dictatorship and horrible, was well developed and she brought me into the scene with Alex and Jessica with her &#34;just right amount&#34; of description-the musty jail cell and prison, the general store cellar, and the fire in lab. I felt like I was right there with them.Characters: I cared about Alex right from the get go and he drew me into the story quickly. He's a widower with a small child whom he loves more than anything in the world. He loved his wife deeply but lost her to a drunk driver after she delivered the baby. When Alex is suddenly transported out of his world and his son is somewhere left behind, or come to find out, won't exist at all if history is altered, I felt all the desperation that I imagine Alex was feeling. He had to get back, but how? He didn't know how to use this device in the first place. I enjoyed Jessica's character as well and the chemistry between her and Alex, although it did move extremely fast for them to fall in love. But in times of traumatic situations, it can happen!Recommendation: This goes well with a cold bottle of water and a power bar because you'll be running the whole time and anything else will weigh you down. I highly recommend Timelapse for those that enjoy time travel, alternative history or even a good romance. It's easily a one sitting read if you have the time.","Athena ""Greek Goddess"""

So, I glanced through the TBR list, found Timelapse, and thought why not. Well surprise, surprise within a few pages I was sucked into an alternate universe where nothing made sense.It was as if I was living the experience with Alex the story&#8217;s hero and main squeeze. His sideline story added a human touch to him. Usually I&#8217;m not a back story gal; I have an issue with patience. So I&#8217;m generally like &#8216;let&#8217;s just get this story on the road, like now&#8217;. In this case however, that dimension of Alex would not have been as clear without the back story. My perception of him would have been less empathetic. His occasional whine based victim behavior would have annoyed me. Because, I knew back story, I was able to just write it off to being a man.I don&#8217;t like reviews that screw up reading surprises. I&#8217;m going to try and do this with no spoilers. First off, I love books that are well edited and well written. This book takes care of both of those, must have needs.My second big buggy boo is under developed characters that are flat. Whose voices you can&#8217;t hear clearly when reading the dialogue. Well this book got a check and check on both. Are these people your standard run of the mill romance characters? No, but that is not a bad thing in this case. They are off beat and more than a little kooky but very likeable and easy to read.The storyline was good, that said I&#8217;m not a big Sci Fi fan. This strikes me as a bit more Steampunk then Sci Fi and I love, love, love Steampunk. Because the author didn&#8217;t forget, this was a romance too. The end result, this is, a fun little kicky story. Sort of Brave New World meets Walden Pond with a little Harry Orwell thrown in for interest and intrigue. The female character Jessie is not you&#8217;re &#8216;heaving bosom in the bracken romance girl.&#8217; She is part chick lit, part Steam Punk and part romance heroine.She has grit and determination and Jessie is tough, I think of her as a stone covered marshmallow. In my opinion, this is what makes her easy to forgive. I did like her don&#8217;t get me wrong although I admit. On occasion, I wanted to shake her then tell her to get it together. I happen to have several friends who bring out that same reaction in me.Overall I have to give a five star folks, it&#8217;s a read and a half, so enjoy.

Throw a history professor with a tragic past into a timeline with an alternate history to his own time - and watch him not only come to terms with it but try to change the world.I loved that Alex wasn't an irritating, macho hero who couldn't be bested - for Jessie decked him more than once. Yet he's a single dad who lost his wife in a tragic accident. The first thing I expected him to do was try to change the events in his past so that he could be reunited with his wife in a perfect reality, yet Ms Farrelly gave us a completely different story that I couldn't have predicted. That made this book far more real to me - because the hero wasn't a selfish bastard who only cared about his own pain. From the outset, he comes across as a real-life, thrown into circumstances that he'll make the best of, type of hero.My only complaint is that the world Alex found himself in isn't described in detail outside of the America he travels through. There's a brief mention of Britain and Europe, but that's all. I know it's not entirely necessary to the story...but I admit I'd have liked to see it.A brilliant alternate history time-travel tale, showing love spans all times and all realities, too.",Demelza Carlton

They come to find one man attempting to create a utopia, unsuspecting of the effects of his actions on the world and time in general.The writing of this story is quite good.

The world he finds himself in is scary and reminded me of the Soviet Union, only worse. The author does a good job of creating this alternate reality, and how even the technology has lagged because of the changes.I also found the main character, Alex, very likable and someone I could easily root for.

From the first page the story captivated me and held my interest until the final page.This is a love story, a very human story, as well as being a sci-fi about time travel. But it was the human interest side which gripped me most.The main character Alex is totally lovable. He is very real as he grieves for his dead wife, retaining the will to live only for the sake of their young son, Jack.When Alex accidently finds a time travel device, which is very much like a mobile phone and I could quite imagine these things becoming a reality, he travels to a world which is unrecognisable from his own.Alex has travelled to an America which is run like something out of 1984 by George Orwell. Citizens live under a strict regime and fear for their lives. Here Alex meets Jessie who is one of the brave fighting for their right to freedom. Of course they fall in love and by a sheer fluke they travel back in time to the attempted assassination of a previous American president. Alex is able to thwart the attempt which was organised by the owner of the time travel device who had sought to create a utopia.Instead, when he learns of the world he created for the likes of people like Jessie, he gives up his device and Jessie and Alex are able to travel back to the present together.I don't wish this review to do an injustice to this story. It is not just a love story but so much more.

However, his main character, Alex, was totally unbelievable. As opposed to another reviewer who like him and was rooting for him, I was praying for him to be shot dead. I forced myself to finish the book so that I wouldn't write a bad review in case it had a great ending.Alex is supposed to be a fairly intelligent assistant professor at a university. Now I can understand when the transformation first occcurs how one might be in shock and possibly do some stupid things. But his stupidity never ended. He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own. On and on - he was shocked when anything was different from his world. No one, and especially not a well educated history professor, is that stupid, over and over and over again.

I wasn't sure how gory the book would be and I was worried that I would not be able to complete the book.The book drew me in and I was unable to put it down. It was full of emotion and suspense and it was next to impossible to figure out what the next page held in store. I fell in love with characters. They were honest and raw.Jesse, a young undercover cop, is a sassy young woman with bad attitude and news written all over her when she shows up looking for work at Morgan's farm.Morgan, sporting her own emotional scars from years gone by meets her match in the saucy young girl, seeing herself in Jesse.Ry, Morgan's life partner and retired psychologist, sees through Jesse's smart mouth and attitude and is determined to help her face her demons.Three women, hanging on for the ride of a life-time, manage to make it through tumultuous days on the farm where Morgan fights to keep her temper in check while all the while wanting to either throttle Jesse, or fire her. Jesse, unconsciously feeling the security that Morgan doesn't realize she gives, tests Morgan at every turn. In the security of these two women, Jesse's hidden memories of the abduction and torture begin to surface, and Morgan and Ry are determine to save her tortured soul.The book has a powerful message contained within its covers. It is a story of courage, of betrayal, of learning to trust again, and in its own way, a coming of age. The descriptive text used throughout the story leaves you spellbound; the plot well written.Alison captures the essence of the tortured mind of a young undercover cop who subconscious buries a time of abduction and torture by a drug Lord. This book is one of those books that beg to be read.","Donna McBroom-Theriot ""My Life. One Story at ..."

29300,B0045EOK9Y,2,A second look at this Novel,A3BOS84MY1SC3E,"[2, 5]","""The Door at the Top of the Stairs"" was written by Alison Holt.  This appears to be a third book for Ms. Holt and a departure from her previous two detective mystery novels. The current novel is of the psychological thriller genre. The book is written in conversational dialog spoken by the characters. The writing is straight forward and does not offer any degree of complexity in structure which should be generally acceptable by a wide audience.The story is about a young female police officer, ""Jesse Shaunessy"" twenty six years old, who was dismissed from the police force after five years of service. The police psychologist assessed Jesse to be too traumatized to continue to serve. Jesse was an undercover narcotics agent. She witnessed her partner ""Pete"" accept a bribe and sell her out to a narcotics dealer who subsequently tortured her in retaliation for shooting his brother.Jesse, looking for work, shows up at the horse farm run by 57 year old Morgan Davis and her 65 year old life partner Dr. Ryland Caldwell. Ryland is a retired psychologist who after observing the odd behavior (and physical scars) on Jesse, engages in her rehabilitation. The story of Jesse's abduction and torture is then revealed through a series of ""regressive sessions"" devised by Ryland as therapy.  While this is all going on, there is a secondary plot afoot being crafted by one Cody Maitland, a college dropout, hired by Morgan as a favor to her neighbor, Cody's father. Cody is featured as a plainly despicable young man bent on causing Jesse to get fired through his plotting of nefarious incidences that Jesse will be blamed for.At about the time that Jesse is recovered from her therapy, the story, in an unexpected twist of events, culminates in the conclusion of the drama and some additional revelations about Jesse and her ordeal.There were a number of things about this book that I did not care for. The character of Jesse and Morgan were a bit too overdone for my likes. While Jesse may have had some reason for her incorrigible behavior, Morgan's was not comprehensible in comparison. Further, I thought the male attributes applied to Morgan made her look foolish at times. The description of Richard as a ""brilliant"" narcissistic killer also seemed misplaced. There was nothing revealed about Richard that lead the reader to conclude that he was ""brilliant"".  Quite the contrary, he came across as decidedly evil, but not particularly bright as evidenced by a number of silly misjudgments.  The Character of Cody seemed equally misplaced. It was uncharacteristic for a young man like Cody to have harbored a hatred so thoroughly consuming as to result in his destruction. That's not to say it couldn't happen, just that there was no particular background given about Cody that explained his behavior and thus left the reader to his own conclusions. Finally, I did not find any appreciation of the life style portrayal of the female characters. While there is nothing inherently wrong (a non-religious view) with such a portrayal, I didn't find it necessary to advance the story. Certainly there have been many good books written with characters of alternate life styles, but these almost entirely are about the characters as persons and not about their life style per se. In this case, the depiction of all the females in the story as lesbian did not offer any necessary structure to the drama. If Morgan had been Martin, it wouldn't have mattered. Unfortunately for me, some of the intimate descriptions made me decidedly uncomfortable - as in the same realm as imagining 26 year old Anna Nicole Smith with 88 year old J. Howard Marshall II.....creepy.Overall I would recommend this novel only with reservations. I think there are underlying issues with it that would disenfranchise too many readers.",Max Read

Her entertainment has fallen sick, her guests are mismatched, and she has mistakenly invited both her cousin Ollie, the Duke of Avondale, and his estranged wife, Belle.  After a whirlwind courtship, the country-bred Belle and the sophisticated Duke of Avondale had married, only to mysteriously separate a month later.  Lady Hathaway is horrified that her party will be the first time Ollie and Belle will see one another again amongst society.  The Duke and Duchess are certainly surprised to find one another in attendance at the party, but the Duke wastes no time trying to force reconciliation with his wife, though more often than not, he manages to exacerbate the situation!  Will it be divorce or will there be reconciliation for the Duke and Duchess?Lady Hathaway&#8217;s House Party is really about how different expectations can set astray even lovers in the honeymoon stage.  There are so many Regency novels about those whirlwind courtships, but not so many, about what happens after the nave young girl marries the charming, sophisticated man.  The novel paints a picture of how a relationship might fall apart, but also how sometimes the hero and heroine must grow quite a bit for it to work.  Most of the novel consists does consist of banter and fighting between the Duke and Duchess, but the fighting is rather bittersweet and often funny in its realism.  It helps too that both Ollie and Belle are appealing and thoughtful characters.  And there is, of course, the trademark Smith humor and comical characters, including the horrible gossip Lady Dempster, Belle&#8217;s ineffectual beau Mr. Henderson, the bosky Italian soprano Signora Travalli, and Lady Hathaway, who attempts to bravely manage a house party that is falling apart at the seams.A charming and fast-paced read, Lady Hathaway&#8217;s House Party offers plenty of romance and comedy!

This is such an important insight, and Columbia's attitude to the whole question is a lesson in itself which is bound to be of great value to everyone who reads it.

So many emotions running through Ellie and Boston, my heart was jumping all over the place as I read this book.  Linda Kage has a way of pulling you into her characters.  Even when they are making bad decisions, you can't help but understand them.  My favorite thing about this book is how wonderful and sweet Boston is when he finds out he has a daughter.  There is nothing more sexy than a man who is a good father.  I also loved the way Ellie and Boston tried to move on with other people but never felt the same connection they did with each other, even after ten years of being separated.

I was in the process of looking for a paranormal romance when I came across Delinquent Daddy by chance. I am so glad I gave this book a chance even though I was skeptical because of the title. Ellie and Boston were so wonderful to read that I wished the book would have gone on forever. Ellie was such as strong character and she just wanted to do what was best for her daughter. She was easy to relate to. She wasn't by any means perfect and admitted when she was wrong. As for Boston, hmm, I loved him and hated him at time. I loved the person who he grew into and wanted to kick his younger butt when they were remembering the past. I am glad that they were able to openly talk about everything to clear the air. Mistakes happen and I love it when I read a book and the characters a 100% perfect. Nobody is perfect; we are all just humans and have our own flaws and mistakes that we learn from. What made this book make 5 stars in my eyes is that it was from both Boston and Ellie's perspective so we get to see how they each felt at certain paints in present day and in the past. It takes a strong person to be able to trust in someone again and for them to let go of the past and move on. If you looking for a good read, this is the book for you.

Boston always missed Ellie and couldn't stop thinking of her when ever there was a rain storm, then one day he read a letter from a little girl looking for her father and it became obvious to him that not only did Ellie not miscarry their child but that the letter was from his daughter Cassidy. So Boston finds Ellie and Cassidy to meet his daughter and to get the truth about what happened nine years earlier from Ellie. This story was a great book about love, forgiveness, and understanding.

I expected this to be a love story, but I never expected it to carry the level of emotion baggage that it did. This is not your hot and steamy romance; this is a love story and the miraculous existence of second chances. Boston and Ellie were made for one another. Everything about them perfectly fits with the other, but life is brutal and fate is tricky, so when they parted ways in college life moved one without them. When all of a sudden nine years later a young girl with a yearning to know her Daddy does the unthinkable and reaches out for a man she is not even sure exists. What comes together in this novel is bitter sweet and honest. Having to learn to forgive is the basis to this story, and the outcome is wonderfully perfect.

Both Boston and Ellie have moved on, yet they are each haunted by memories of the other. Boston is stunned when he discovers that he is the father of Ellie's daughter, Cassidy, and he wastes no time establishing a relationship with the girl. The attraction between Boston and Ellie is stronger than ever, but their mistrust and bitterness over past mistakes and lies continually comes between them.Delinquent Daddy by Linda Kage is a compelling story of love and forgiveness. Boston and Ellie are likeable protagonists with all too human flaws. They both make their fair share of mistakes both in the past and in the present, yet their ability to accept responsibility for their actions allows for tremendous growth. There is no shortage of conflict as Ellie and Boston work to resolve their issues, and at times, it feels like they are making little progress. With a great deal of maturity and an amazing ability to compromise, Boston and Ellie do manage to find workable solutions for the problems facing them.Boston's relatives offer a strong and loving support system for him, and they provide an added depth to Delinquent Daddy. Ellie's friendship with her neighbor Nora is heartwarming, poignant, and humorous. Cassidy is a typical nine year old girl, and her staunch friendship with Nora's son, Keller, is touching.Ms. Kage keeps Delinquent Daddy moving at a fast pace with a careful mix of flashbacks of Boston and Ellie's college romance and present day events.

It was such an amazing experience that I went on a three day bender: Day One: The Trouble with Tomboys, Day Two: How to Resist Prince Charming, Day Three: Delinquent Daddy.I read Delinquent Daddy in one sitting. I started it one night after work and stayed up until 2 o'clock in the morning to finish it. This romance novel was an emotional roller coaster rider that had me feeling all sorts of emotions. This novel had me sobbing, laughing, smiling, cheering, yelling, and feeling like I had been punched in the gut. It was heartbreaking. It was hopeful. It was sweet. And, it was extremely touching.Throughout this novel we are introduced to two versions of Boston Kincaid and Ellie Trenton: Boston and Ellie in their college years and Boston and Ellie ten years later. It was remarkable how much the characters changed in ten years. Their growth was drastic and obvious. Boston went from being a selfish, snobby jerk to a mature, thoughtful man. Ellie went from being a shy, nave schoolgirl to a loving, nurturing mother. I enjoyed seeing both the past and present versions of the characters.I really connected with the two main characters, Boston and Ellie. I loved both characters, but I didn't always agree with their actions. I got mad at both characters plenty of times. They both made their share of mistakes in the past and in the present, but in the end, I forgave them both for their mistakes and rooted for them to find happiness.Delinquent Daddy sat on my ""to-read"" shelf for a couple of months. The synopsis grabbed my attention and the high ratings made me look twice, but when it came to actually purchasing this novel, the title and the book cover held me back, mainly the title. Every time I read ""Delinquent"", I thought juvenile delinquent. I don't know. It just didn't encourage me to pick this book up. I am so glad that I was introduced to Linda Kage and all of her fabulousness recently because if I hadn't read The Trouble with Tomboys then this book would most likely still be sitting on my ""to-read"" shelf, which would be a shame. I most likely would have picked this book up eventually, but I am glad that I read this book sooner rather than later. It was a wonderful experience, and I hate to think that I might have missed out on it.I gave Delinquent Daddy by Linda Kage 5 STARS. This was my third Linda Kage novel in three days. I think it's safe to say that I'm obsessed!PS: I recommend this novel for fans of Take this Regret by Amy Lichtenhan and vice versa.-XOXOREADING, EATING & DREAMINGFOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF","READING, EATING &amp; DREAMING"

In fact, enjoyed all three so much, I went from book 1, 2, 3 in just a matter of days... each time looking forward to the next. Now, I am eagerly waiting for the next two to follow.I would say, the only negative I can give is the length of each. Each was a bit too short. Each ending, although leaving you to want more.... left me feeling there 'should' have been a bit more in each book. A bit left unsaid. In my mind, these three books, rather than three should have been made into two. It is the only reason I gave it a 4, rather than 5 star.I look forward to reading the final two in this series and more from this author!",Charlotte Watkins

The one problem I have with this book (and possibly the whole trilogy) is the main character is untouchable! Rather that be in the middle of fighting or with his fellow vikings! Throughout the book he is put up against situations that he miraculously escapes from. Does it get predictable after the first few chapters? A little bit. Honestly Halfdan is beginning to get under my skin.  I'm rooting for the Franks!With that being said, the story is really good and fast paced (much faster than book one.) It seems most of the development took place in book one which has left more room for action and adventure, which is nice. (And there is loads of it) Very few (and I stress that) authors, that I have read, can transport the reader as good as Roberts. I felt as if I was there smelling the smoke and tasting the salted pork or hearing the swords strike and arrows fly. Such amazing skill he has putting life into words.Not quite a 4 but better than a 3. So, 3.5 stars.This book reminds me of a summer blockbuster with some over-the-top action that leaves you saying 'really?' But in the end still entertaining enough that you can walk away satisfied.

She has spent her entire life walking around never hearing the sounds of birds chirping or running water. Imagine the thoughts that ran through her head when a goose came up to her and began talking. Poor Aurora contemplated the possibility that she was going insane, however, she would learn that the goose was from a place she thought was all in her mind. The Other Realm, a short story by Deatri King-Bey, is where Aurora will find all that she has been missing in her life.Once the goose, named Tahlan, found her and requested her company to journey back to where they belong, things that she once needed clarification on became crystal clear. Tahlan and Aurora had more than just a connection to the other realm. It was their quest to fully understand their connection in order to accomplish the mission on which they were embanking. With Tahlan and Aurora both being strong-headed people, will they ever take the necessary time needed to truly know one another? Or, will they fail at their mission, all because they refused to bend?I like supernatural books. Ms. King-Bey provided me with an out of-this-world experience.

While reading this book I kept waiting for certain things to happen because they always happen in her Historical Romances.I love that her books are real &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; romances. There is never anything more than some passionate kissing. I love that the characters blush at innuendo. Her characters are hard working, honest people who care about and look out for others. They are uplifting and make me smile.I&#8217;ve never been disappointed with one of Marcia&#8217;s books. They are my favorite escape. If you like good clean romance I recommend you give her a try.Content: A clean read with nothing more than kissing and a couple of the mildest of expletives that aren&#8217;t allowed to be uttered in my house but that I allow in a book like this.Rating: 5 Stars because I didn&#8217;t want to put it down.","toobusyreading ""Inspired Kathy"""

I read the first few paragraphs of several books, looking for something that would engage my sleep-deprived self and wasn't so 'deep' or 'dry' that I had to put all of my concentration into reading.  When the first few pages of the book yielded mentions of both massively-multiplayer online role-play gaming and Surprise, Arizona, I knew I had a winner.  And I was not disappointed.While the plot yielded few surprises, I can't fault Ms. Bennett for that; this book wasn't meant to be 'suspense' or 'mystery' after all.  Instead it was a fun, engaging look at a life turned upside-down and the main character's attempts to right it again.  There is a wide array of characters present, all of them believable and interesting.  The first-person narrative is easy to read without being simplistic, and there are a lot of laugh out loud moments throughout the book.Circle City Blues is, simply put, one of the very best romance-slanted indie books I've read.

But Trish is one tough cookie, yes indeed.  This would make a great movie, and I figure they could even adapt it to fit into the ""Die Hard"" franchise by getting Mary Elizabeth Winstead to reprise her role as John McClane's daughter (fromLive Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray]), and base the movie on her, instead of her famous father.  The book features some really ""bad"" bad guys (and one girl).  Every time they think they have killed Trish or have her trapped she survives and keeps coming back.

34617,B004CLYO8W,5,A fast-moving fun read,A1Z6VWDAZIJX69,"[2, 2]","Mortal Pursuit by Michael Prescott writing as Brian Harper  is an e-edition of a previously published book (Signet, 1997) when cell phones didn't exist and some verbalization and references are slightly dated. However, it is a story of non-stop action that still provides one of the better action stories I have read.Trish Robinson, a newly appointed police officer in the small town of Santa Barbara is on her first patrol with Pete Wald, her training officer. They receive a call about a prowler in the yard of a local, prominent and very wealthy, family. They answer the call and the non-stop action begins and continues to the very end with Trish involved in endless life-threatening situations.With respect to the mechanics of presentation, suffice it to say, that Prescott/Harper has so intricately woven all of the features together that further description can only interfere with the reader's enjoyment. Additionally, he has characterized Trish and her involvement so adroitly, that even when some of her feats stretch credibility, your reader will not take time to analyze them - a feat not often accomplished by an author.I recommend the book highly as a fun read, unless you find violence against women, even in murder mysteries, too abhorrent.

It's a lot of bang for the buck!This is my second book by Michael Prescott. I rated it at just three stars only because I started to feel I'd been 'had' intellectually. Yes it is very suspenseful. But maybe it is too suspenseful. I came to the conclusion that Prescott lays out a basic plot for the main story. Then invents a sub-story that he thinks he might be able to connect in some ways to that main plot. Then fills each plot with several obstacles for the protagonist to overcome. Then finds many ways for the protagonist to fail, at least partially, in completing those obstacles, hits the protagonist with a number of serious wounds. It becomes ridiculous.For example, Trish, a twenty-four-year-old rookie cop was traumatized as a nine-year-old when her girl friend was kidnapped, raped and murdered. Then in her first challenge as a rookie cop, she ends up facing the same guy who gets a chance to kill her again. And the Glock 9mm she has in her hand when he approaches her at the end is loaded with blanks. Yet, never fear, she happens to have an old indian arrowhead in her pocket that just happens to fit down the 9mm barrel. Yup. That's how she kills him.

34930,B004D4YL3Q,5,Review from: My Overstuffed Bookshelf,A1U09Q4OP6XIK6,"[2, 3]","When I first read a review about this book over at Smexy Books, I was intrigued on how an author was going to write about such a touchy subject.  Most authors won't even cross into the ""rape"" fantasies because they are considered taboo.  Luckily, one of my favorite authors was willing to not only write about it, but blow my expectations out of the water!Almost every erotic book I have read includes some sort of fantasy or role play during the sex act.  What I found interesting in this book is the fantasy of being raped but in a consenting and pleasurable role play.  Most people would shy away from this, myself included.  The way the author portrays it in the book though, it is focused more on the aftermath than the actual rape itself.  Yes, Tania loved playing out these fantasies with her loving and devoted husband, but that changed once someone takes the control away and forces himself on her after her husband dies in an accident.  When Tania decides to take back her life though, she turns to the one person she trusts the most.  She asks her husbands best friend Drake to help her work through it.Ah, Drake.  He has got to be one of my favorite Hero's in a story.  He has the sex appeal, the caring and understanding mind, the ability to express his thoughts instead of holding them, and a Superman tattoo to seal the deal!  Drake has always had a thing for Tania.  He is willing to help her take back her life, but in the process he falls even deeper in love with her.  A true Hero that not only saves the girl, but captures her heart at the same time. *sigh*While I agree that this book is not for everyone, if you do decide to venture out and expand your reading base of erotic romance, then this one will be the one.  I am glad I gave it a chance and I fell in love with Drake and Tania.  The story was hot, steamy and sexy with just the right amount of suspense, heartbreak and angst that kept it balanced.  Plus, Drake can be my Superman anytime!",A. Jacobs

People be forewarned...this is a very erotic short story that includes some bondage, spanking and rape fantasy role playing. In other words...this book is HAWT. There were a couple of times while I was reading it on the elliptical that I had to stop it was that smoking hot. I kept checking my Itouch to make sure it hadn't caught on fire. Me - I wasn't so lucky because hose me down Batman...I was burning up!If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then you probably shouldn't read Beg Me but really you'd be missing out on a great story if you decide to skip it. Beg Me is about taking back your life, learning to live and trust again while you fight against your fears to regain everything you've lost that matters to you.Tania Sinclair lost the love of her life, her husband in a tragic car accident. In addition she's been betrayed by someone close to her...her husband's twin brother who to add insult to injury used her own dark fantasies to brutally rape and terrorize her. Now the dark, kinky bedroom behaviour that used to bring Tania such joy, leaves her feeling cold and scared to death.It's been two long years, but Tania is finally ready to stop hiding and start living again. She's got a plan...going to start slow...take baby steps...and she's got the perfect person in mind to help execute the plan...her husband`s best friend Drake Bennett.To me Drake made this story. He's the perfect hero, in fact his nickname is Superman (this has another meaning in Beg Me and if you want to find out what it is - you'll have to read the story). Besides the fact that he is super sexy, he's the ultimate best friend a girl can have. Drake is protective, giving, caring, understanding and willing to do and be anything Tania needs him to be to help get over her fears. There is no mistaking that Tania's needs and wishes are Drake's number one priority even when she asks the ultimate of him and he has second thoughts about carrying out her request. Don't get me wrong, Drake is by no means a bystander in their relationship, in fact he can get down and dirty with the best of them given the right incentive.Everyone needs a superhero in their life...someone to scare away the bogeyman and check for monsters under the bed and every girl should be so lucky to have their very own Superman.

34933,B004D4YL3Q,4,Beg Me by Shiloh Walker,A1W5WDICY81WQ3,"[7, 7]","Tania Sinclair not only has lost her husband three years ago, but she went through a brutal rape by her husband's twin brother a year later. Tania likes her sex rough and she loved to play out rape fantasies with her husband. Obviously her husband never hurt her and it was all just a game in the bedroom. But when her husband's mentally unstable brother gets wind of the kind of stuff Tania likes, he forces her to have sex.Two years later, Tania is still struggling with moving past that experience. Drake Bennett was Kyle's best friend and he still looks out for Tania. She trusts him and turns to him now that she knows she must move on from the rape. And in order to do that, she needs new memories. She needs someone to have sex with, someone who can play out the fantasy she needs, and someone who will not hurt her.Drake has been in love with Tania for years and when she propositions him with sex, no strings attached, he knows he is the man for the job. As he gives her what she needs, being slow and gentle or hard and rough when needed, he can't keep his love buried.Beg Me is the second rape fantasy book I have read recently (the other being Willing Victim by Cara McKenna) but the difference in this book is that the heroine loves rape fantasy, but unfortunately gets raped. And I think Shiloh Walker does an excellent job describing the horrific incident and struggle Tania has gone through, yet still keeps the book very sexy and romantic.Although Tania likes rough sex and rape fantasy, and she knows she needs to get back to that point in her sex life to move on from the actual rape, there is also a very fine line Drake has to walk so he doesn't push her too hard too fast. Once Drake gets a feel for how much Tania can handle..oh man does he become a dirty, sexy hero.Drake is such a gentleman, and loves Tania so much. He takes the responsibility of having sex with her very seriously, which might not sound romantic, but really it a very sexy thing to do. The best thing he does is give Tania back her control. And in the process, he gives her so much love that it is impossible for her to not accept it.Beg Me is a very intense, hot book but offers romance and for a shorter book, takes you on quite the emotional journey.

34939,B004D4YL3Q,4,Bravely Written Romance (B+ Grade),A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,"[2, 3]","When I first heard about Shiloh Walker's Beg Me, I wasn't certain if I would try and read it. But after reading some great reviews, I took the chance. The subject matter deals with a heroine who has been brutally raped, who feels the only way she can take back her sexuality and enjoy those forced sex or rape like fantasies she once enjoyed with her husband is to act out those fantasies again with a man she can trust irrevocably. Not many authors I know of can write a rape fantasy romance where I don't end up squirming, uneasy by what I'm reading. Count me as one who is not a fan of pseudo-rape in romance, period. But what Shiloh Walker has done with Beg Me, is a rounding success. This may be my favorite book of hers behind Beautiful Girl. She not only taps into the heroine and hero's psyche and their fears, but also the reader's. Shiloh shows that the heroine Tania shouldn't be ashamed of her wants and desires even after she has been horribly sexually abused.When Tania Sinclair lost her beloved husband Kyle three years ago in a car accident, she never thought things could get worse. But for Tania it did when one January, Kyle's unstable twin brother, Kent, who knew all about Kyle and Tania's love life, ended up raping her. Tania fought back and killed Kent before he could rape her again. But even though he's no longer among the living, he destroyed everything special she had with Kyle. And now when she thinks back to those special moments she had with Kyle, where they made passionate love and role-played where Tania pretended she was being raped, she feels dirty and sick. She needs to take back her life and give into her sexual desires once again. That's when she turns to Drake, a childhood friend of Kyle's, and now her best friend.Drake has loved Tania for years, but because she belonged to another, he would never think of intruding. He could see how Kyle and Tania loved one another dearly, and even once walked in on one of their games that both shocked him, as well as turned him on. He wants to be there for Tania and assumes she only thinks of him as a friend. But this all changes when Tania asks him to help her take her fantasies back, and that means for Drake to be more than forceful when they are intimate, just like when she was with her husband. Drake enjoys rough sex, but what Tania asks him crosses some moral lines for him. The main question Drake asks himself if he can give Tania what she wants so she can heal, while not losing his soul in the process.At around one-hundred pages, Beg Me packs a punch. Drake is wonderfully caring and very dedicated to Tania. He would do anything for her, even going as far as giving her what she wants knowing he's not too thrilled with the idea. Drake will allow Tania to use him even if he has to do this by giving into her rape fantasy. At first Tania doesn't realize how much she's asking Drake, and those long last effects on his conscious. But as they cross those questionable lines, they both come to some important realizations about each other.I must applaud Shiloh for taking a chance on writing Beg Me. This is one steamy and emotional read about two people who must come to terms with the emotional upheavals in their lives. From Tania's horrific trauma, she finds the strength to fight back with the help of a friend who sacrifices himself for the woman he loves. This is one bravely written novel I recommend you read.Katiebabs","Katie Babs ""Katiebabs"""

Now, she is still trying to cope with the loss of... well, everything. The only person she feels she can turn to in order to feel any semblance of security is her husband's best friend Drake, who has harbored feelings for her for several years.Seeing the events of the past mix with Tania's haunting present tugged at m heartstrings, and I admit I cried more than once. The depth of emotion that plays out on the pages ripped me in two. Both Tania and Drake were dealing with the death of Tania's husband, as well as the aftermath of the attack on Tania, and their sorrow was a tangible thing. There were a few times that I had to set my iPad down for a minute or two simply because I wasn't sure I could handle it all in one sitting.The entire story was intense and incredibly emotional. The trauma that Tania survived is something I can't even begin to imagine, much less how she managed to move on from it. I could feel the depth of her despair, and my heart shattered over and over again. I loved how loyal and true Drake is to her - he's the very definition of knight in shining armor.I did have an issue with how Tania chose to overcome her fears, but only because it was written so well that I felt everything right along with them. It wasn't an easy scene to read, despite the fact that I know Tania felt it necessary to do what she did. (to be fair - there is a warning at the beginning of the book)",Mama Kitty

The acts between the hero & heroine are consensual, but they may not be ideal for all readers...Tania Sinclair was happily married to Kyle, a man who adored her and indulged her in her kinky fantasies. Then a car accident took him away from her. Not long after, someone she trusted attacked her leaving her scared and broken. Two years later, she's tired of waiting for things to go back to normal, and she wants to take her life, as well as her fantasies, back. There's only one person she can think of, who she trusts enough to make that happen, Drake Bennett. He was Kyle's best friend and hers too.Drake has been in love with Tania since the first time they met, but she was already taken. He;s always been there for her, through good times and bad. More so after the attack on her two years ago. He'd do anything for her because he loves her. When she approaches him with her plea, he doesn't know if he should do it. He wants to because it's her, but he doesn't want to because she doesn't feel about him the way he does about her, and that would just shred his heart up when she got what she wanted. Where would that leave them?This is definitely not one of those insanely hot, fluffy romantic stories most of us are used to. Not to say that it wasn't hot, but with Tania's attack and her fantasies at the core of this, it makes it a little difficult to feel anything other than sadness and pain for what she had to go through.Some people might find her fantasies somewhat disturbing or even disgusting. However, fantasies play an important role in anyone's sex life, so really anything goes when two people are willing and trust each other. She was married, and she shared these fantasies with her husband, and no one got hurt.Moving on, the chemistry between the two characters was off the charts. Drake's best characteristic was the way he loved, and the depth of that love. He didn't push, and he didn't try to fix her. My heart broke for Tania, especially when I found out who attacked her. It just made her emotional devastation even more poignant. The feelings they both exhibit is passionate but raw. One can't help but root for these two.The only thing that put me off was the endless repetition towards the end of the story as Tania tries to get her point across to Drake; reiterating over and over why she wants him to do a certain thing to her. It was heart-breaking to read, mostly for Drake's sake at that point. This story isn't for everybody, but I found the honesty behind their feelings eventually overcame the dark theme.","MsRomanticReads ""Michelle"""

Asking her best friend Drake to help her overcome her fear of the attack and find her love of sexual role-playing seems like an easy request. Something she would only trust him with.Drake doesn't even think twice about saying yes to the woman he's been in love with for years. He'd do anything to take away her pain. If she needs him to be a sex toy to overcome her obstacles, he will surely do it. Saying is a lot easier than doing though, and his heart contracts at their first encounter. Drake has a problem now, he's falling more in love with every look, every touch and quickly getting in over his head.When the past rears its ugly head and the truth of that fateful night is shoved into the sun. The depth of betrayal will shake Tania to her core. Its fight or flight...Tania has to choose. Regain her sexual independence or forever lock her heart away.Beg Me was a short novel that I won't soon forget. It was powerful, emotional and kept me interacted. This is NOT a read for someone who doesn't like role-playing, rape fantasies, aspects of dominance or the interaction of them all combined.The idea of a rape fantasy honestly intrigued me. I'm no prude, I know all about fetishes and fantasies and the trust you need to have in your partner if you attempt to engage in anything like that. Complete and total trust. I think it has more to do with the dominance and submission then it does with actual rape. The idea of being ""forced"", but not really because you're with your partner, plays on the whole strength aspect. The age-old push and pull of power.Shiloh navigated the waters of this touchy subject wonderfully in my mind. She wrote with complete conviction and made me feel as if I could get inside Tania's head. Understand her sexual needs to feel safe but restrained. Drakes character made me sigh over and over again. Where are these men? Seriously...where? He was totally attuned to her every emotion, whim and need. Even when things got too much for him he did what she needed him to in order to get over her attack. The sex scenes were beautifully written with explicit detail and left me with my mouth hanging open in appreciation.Tania's mother-in-law was a creepy addition to the storyline. She had some serious mental issues herself I think. I was kind of surprised that her struggle was wrapped up so nice and neat at the end. I thought for sure Shiloh was going to take it further then she did. The solution felt a bit too neat for me in that regard.In the end the book was more about letting go then any fantasy contained on its pages. Learning to find yourself, find that light and attack it...claim it....and get yourself back in the process.Nikki- Ramblings From A Chaotic Mind",Nikki B
34944,B004D4YL3Q,2,Beg Me,A2EU9VP0MRMUGE,"[1, 1]","I read this novella as part of the Bound Temptations anthology but this review just includes my thoughts on Beg Me:Now, I'll admit that if I'd realised the contents of this story before I picked the anthology up I probably wouldn't have read it so I'm not really the best person to judge this one. I'm not a fan of rape fantasies but I decided to give it a try because I like the author's writing style. I did like Tania at first, she had been through a horrible ordeal after the death of her husband and then being raped in her own home and I felt really bad for her. I can't even begin to imagine how messed up that would have left her and I admired her for wanting to take her life back and replace the bad memories with good ones. Drake was her husbands best friend and has been in love with Tania forever, he has always been there for her and was understandably the first one that she turned to.Now I consider myself quite an open minded person and although Tania's fantasy isn't my idea of fun I don't have a problem with it as long as the people involved are consenting adults. The bondage side to their relationship and the dirty talk was fine and was even quite hot in places but events towards the end left me cold. Where it went wrong for me was when Tania practically forced Drake to do something that he was obviously very uncomfortable with - she was trying to wipe away the memories of her own rape which I can understand to a degree but that doesn't give her the right to force the man she is supposed to be falling for into doing something that hurt him emotionally. I felt so bad for Drake, he loves Tania so much that he would do anything for her and I felt she took advantage of that and it really made me dislike her. That scene ruined the whole novella for me which was such a shame.",Sarah (Feeling Fictional)
34945,B004D4YL3Q,2,Not that good for me,A37J3XRX1TENTS,"[6, 7]","With Beg Me, I just don't know what to say. I am really disappointed with this story. I happen to love stories with rough sex, forced sex, or rape roleplay. So I knew this part of the story wouldn't bother me at all.The heroine does like it raunchy with some dirty talk like 'hot bi***' and 'dirty slut.' I love this. I also love the bondage and domination both characters are into. Even the heroine's recent traumatic past didn't upset me, at least not in a bad way. I was prepared to feel sympathetic toward her. So why didn't I like this book then?Despite having all the above elements going for it, this story was just flat to me, very one dimensional. It's a pale imitation of every good/great story with the same themes. Yes, some parts of it were sexy, but the story was so deficient in other areas.I didn't dislike the heroine but I also wasn't that into her at first. Then she became unlikeable to me. The way she treated the hero, by making him do something he really felt sick at heart about; that just really ticked me off. So given what she's been through, this justifies her right to tear him up inside in order to make herself feel better? Sure, she wants to take back her sex life, but the disregard she showed him annoyed me. The man would do anything for her, and she asks him to do the unbearable. The guy's practically sick to his stomach, but it's ok as long as it makes her feel better? The h comes across as weak and selfish.Other parts of the story were just as annoying: the overdrawn mother-in-law character, the h's absolutely ineffective confrontation with MIL, the H's watered-down manhood (I mean, the h virtually turned him into a punching bag for someone else's transgressions), the poor editing, and the overall unsatisfactory storytelling.The hero was the only slightly bright spot of the story and even he couldn't save it from itself. He had his moments but not enough to offset the actions of the heroine.To me, this is just not a good read, not even an okay read.If you want to try a good story with some of the same elements but with some really thought-out characters, maybe sample these -Willing Victim(rough sex, rape fantasy, domination)Helene Blackmailed(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)On the Edge(rough sex, domination, menage)Demon's Captive(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)",S.

34946,B004D4YL3Q,4,Beg Me reviewed by The Book Vixen,A14ZYUOM6A8LY4,"[17, 19]","Why I Read this Book: I have been wanting to try contemporary erotic romance for a while now. To be honest, I was a bit intimidated. I didn't know what to expect or just how `erotic' erotic would be, especially when I saw the warning on this book:Warning: This book involves light bondage play, rape fantasy & role-playing. The acts between the hero & heroine are consensual, but they may not be ideal for all readers...I was a bit hesitant when I read rape fantasy. I have never read anything like that before and I didn't know what to expect. So I took a deep breath, put my big girl panties on and decided to hand my contemporary erotic romance v-card over to Shiloh Walker. I love her writing style and really enjoyed reading Broken and The Missing so I put my trust in her hands and she didn't disappoint.What I Liked: This book packed quite a punch for only being a little over 100 pages! I didn't think a story could come full circle, let alone such an emotional story, in so few pages but this author did just that. Beg Me read like a full length novel.I felt such a strong connection with Tania and Drake. I ached for Tania, who'd literally been to hell and back. The traumatizing experience that robbed her of her precious memories with her husband broke my heart. The last couple of years have been really intense for her. All she wants to do is put it all behind her so she can move on and enjoy the sexual fantasies she once desired and she wants Drake to help her. Drake's been in love with Tania since before she married his best friend. What he wants more than anything else is to be with her but that requires conquering some emotional hurdles.What I Didn't Like: I can't think of anything I didn't like. This was my first time reading contemporary erotic romance so I don't have anything to compare it to.Overall Impression: Shiloh Walker has (again) delivered a hot, steamy, emotional read. While she writes titillating love scenes, she also tugs at your heart strings. Beg Me focuses on not just the sex but the relationship between these characters as well.  The raw emotions felt by the two main characters was intense. You can feel the chemistry between Tania and Drake.While I enjoyed reading Beg Me, I will say that this is not a book for everyone. The main characters in this book enjoy partaking in rough sex and rape fantasies. Let's tackle the elephant in the room - the rape fantasy element. The participants are willing and the sex is consensual. It's role playing. There are safeguards in place, which made me feel more comfortable about reading it. If you're okay with this and if you're looking for a quick, hot read then Beg Me is it. If you looking for a contemporary erotic romance read to pop your cherry (like I was), then I think Beg Me is a good way to go.",The Book Vixen

The author was skilled at reminding the reader each time a secondary or tertiary character appeared what that character&#8217;s role was, which helped keep the abundant cast organized in my head.Cons: Occasionally there were several characters in a scene, and I lost track of who was talking and would have to backtrack. Some paragraphs were a little long, and a few times I caught myself skimming. It didn't happen very often, but often enough I feel obliged to mention it.Humor is a tough sell.  You never know if somebody else will share your sense of humor and make you laugh. Most of this book was tongue-in-cheek, so I&#8217;m not surprised that the 1- and 2-stars reviewers didn't get it.For me, the charm was in the style of writing. I won&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s metered like poetry, but I suspect the author read it aloud and adjusted words and syllables as needed to maintain rhythm.

His momma runs a floating, high-stakes poker game, ably assisted by her housekeeper. There's the usual assortment of nutballs and crazy people you'll find in nearly any small town, and, although they're cliches, each and every one, the author handles them all well and presents them without sneering or going overboard. Bubba is one of those rare good ol' boys you can actually like and might want to have as a friend and his unusual cast of neighbors, friends and acquaintances actually add to the story.The mystery plot actually worked well...at least, I didn't figure out whodunnit in the first four chapters, which is another point in the author's favor...and there were no sudden, ""out of the blue"" revelations or ungainly plot twists involved.

The narrative will make you feel as though someone is scratching their fingernails on a chalkboard- in your mind. You want to quit and delete this book so many times, that early on its hard to focus on reading it. Several things will keep you clicking the Kindle.1. Bevill has peopled his story with simple down-home characters whom, although they are cartoonishly drawn sterotypes, are intensely likeable. You care about them even though you would probably be a little repelled by their oafishness in their presence.2. The dialogue is pretty good. As long as Bevill keeps them talking to each other the phrasing has 'snap'. The second the narrative begins you start thinking of giving up and deleting the book.3. The plot is strong and Bevill drives it along as a good pace. You are never bored waiting for something to happen. I was really quite pleasantly surprised at the twists Bevill takes in the plot resolution.In short, this is a winner and you wont be sorry you spent the time reading it.

After all, their last meeting three years earlier was less than friendly. Now, the good folks of Pegramville, Texas are wondering if Bubba might be a tad guilty. After all, he had caught his fianc&eacute;e in bed with another man.Bubba and the Dead Woman is the first installment in this funny, delightful series. Bubba is a decent, average guy who tolerates his feisty, gun-loving, poker-playing mother, Miss Demetrice. The plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested, and the tone, pacing, and humor was great. Miss Demetrice is a hoot and although Bubba keeps landing in jail, the place seems more like a social club than an oppressive detention center.As with other humorous cozies, logic was stretched at some points. I don't know much about small Texas towns, but when the jailor, who believes in Bubba's innocence, allows him to sneak out of jail (accompanied by the jailor and another prisoner), to interview people, I had to work hard to suspend disbelief. Plenty of cozy mystery fans, however, will go along with the lapses in logic for the sheer fun of finding out what happens next.

Like other reviewers, I'm not 100% sure that all the malapropisms, punctuation errors, and random ""which""s were intentional, but they were entertaining either way. I have no expertise to say whether the dialect was accurate as small-town Texan, but it did effectively convey speech habits--if not exact word choices--that I have heard in many small towns. I was not entirely convinced by many of the mystery plot elements (for example, would not cutting wires to security cameras that the employees knew were fake be a clever way to direct attention away from the employees rather than exonerating employees?). Other examples would go too far towards spoiling the plot. As another reviewer has noted, the characters are cliches, but, presumably, that was part of the humor--the chapter headings were so cliched as to approach parody, and that feature was, I'm sure, intentional. Whether or not ALL of the amusing elements were intentional, writing a funny book that includes murder requires considerable skill. I believed Bubba's sadness, the husband's grief, and the parents' bewilderment--those were not funny--which gave me as a reader a sort of permission to laugh at the rest.This book is an excellent example of Stanley Fish's reader-response theory: how much a reader enjoys this book will depend at least as much on the individual reader as on the book.  If you want fine literature, compelling characterization, or careful plotting, look elsewhere. If you want a fast read for light entertainment, put down your red editing pen and try ""Bubba and the Dead Woman.""",Eleanor Latham

The main reason I downloaded it for my Kindle was that I was quite taken with the blurb and encouraged by the reviews I read. I also liked the fact that it was set in a small town in East Texas and had a main character called Bubba Snoddy. We find out very early on that Bubba used to be in the military and stands at 6 feet 4 inches tall, weighs 250 pounds and is a gentle giant. He is smart and patient in that &#8220;Southern Hospitality&#8221; way and finds himself in all kinds of trouble in this story, through no fault of his own.Having lived in mid-south USA for several years myself, when I read anything set in the south I can hear those southern accents as I read the dialogue. This book was no exception and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so that I will definitely BUY the next ebook in the series, just to see what happens to Bubba next. I liked C.L. Bevill&#8217;s writing style and as a result of reading this book I searched for more of her work, which I also found on Amazon.So back to Bubba and The Dead Woman. Bubba is a mechanic at Bufford&#8217;s Gas and Grocery Store which is owned by a mean man called George Bufford who is currently off gallivanting with his secretary in the Bahamas whilst his wife is taking care of the store at home. When we first join Bubba he is on the phone to a very disgruntled Bufford employee who should have been working that night with Bubba, but, for some reason is resigning over the phone. Because of this and as it is Mrs Bufford&#8217;s night off, Bubba ends up being the only employee working at Bufford&#8217;s for the whole of the night shift. When he gets home from work the next morning he finds a dead woman lying head first in the long weeds at the side of the caretakers house, which is where Bubba lives. Things get more complicated from there and before you know it Bubba is in the thick of a mystery that involves confederate bullion and the long arm of the law.This was an adorable book to read, I loved every minute of it and really grew fond of Bubba, his dog, Precious and his mother, Miz Demetrice. The characters were very reminiscent of many people I met whilst living in mid-South USA and the way the small town picture is painted is indeed accurate, as I recall it.

There was enough to let me figure it out, but not so obvious as to make me want to just skip to the end.

Someone is out to get him. But who? With the help of friends, family, and the lovely Deputy Willodean Gray, he sets out to find the real killer. More mystery than romance.",lanlynk

He rarely says the right thing, he gets arrested way too often, and, even though he's probably in his mid-30s, he still lives with his mother in Snoddy Mansion, the reputed hiding place of gold stashed during the Civil War.  His neighbors are silly crazy as are his cousins and most everyone else in Pegramville.From page one of this clean, quick read, Bubba and his cohorts will have you laughing, and before you know it, you too will be immersed in the mystery of the dead woman on Bubba's lawn.Ms. Bevill plays with language and voice throughout, adding to the richness of this story and its characters.

It was a pleasant parody and caricature of ""types"" that prompted an occasional smile at the phraseology .I found myself liking Bubba as a character but can't say the same for the other portrayals  except maybe the Madam and  Mike the young arsonist. Bubba's mother was so exaggerated as to be particularly annoying.I did think the author channeled Charles Dickens' naming tendencies with a Texas bent...especially the entire Snoddy clan or such characters as  Stenson Posey, Adelia Cedarbloom, Wilma Rabsitt and Roscoe Stinedurf .I thought the book went on a little too long, and I certainly got tired of hearing about Willodean's remarkable green eyes as Bubba played the lovesick fool.Regarding  the typos...it appears the author may have done some revision...for example ""Camaro"" is spelled correctly  in the edition I downloaded. She still has a way to go... it's ""genteel"" not "" gentile"" and ""basal"" not ""Basel, "" plus a number of words are erroneously split up such as ""law suits,"" ""above board"" and ""hand cuffs.""Regardless, I might take a look at another Bubba saga.",Leapin' Literary Lurkers

When he gets home from a rough day, er, night at work where he should have been fixin' cars instead of manning the register, he finds a dead woman in his backyard.  And not any old dead woman but his ex-fiance.  While Bubba is standing there in shock, trying to figure out what to do, the realtor that has been trying to buy his mother's land with her run down house on it to make a SuperWalmart (of course) makes a call to the Sheriff's Department to report the dead body.  Of course, the Sheriff comes down, figures out that Bubba is the only person in town who knew the recently departed, and decides then and there that Bubba musta done it.I wasn't sure of this book at first, I will say.  But, it had me laughing.  I loved the language, as anyone who has even lived in the south will recognize words that don't exist anywhere else, as well as how people say things.  The author captured this very well.  No matter what Bubba does, he seems to just get himself into more trouble, bruising up probably every part of his body at some time.  And when suspicion might be able to cast in another direction, something else happens to just make it worse for him.  I think my favorite was the scene with the hole.  While there are many different holes discussed being dug up on the property, that one particular part was just too much.  The characters all stand by themselves, and I would love to see more of what happens in this little town.I apparently read the revised version, so I didn't notice too many of the ""glaring"" errors notated by others.  However, what I did notice was spelling done in such a way to create the language, such as ifin or fella.  What I loved was the fact that this book didn't just use words from every day language, and I found a lot of big words I would never find in other books.  Great play on extremes.",Liza

A humorous, tongue-in-cheek suspense drama with Bubba the lead man in solving the murder he is accused of and has to spend a few days in jail for. His mama is ready to rewrite Texas history if he is not released immediately and she makes sure everyone, from the governor to the local jailer knows what lies ahead in their future if they refuse to listen! She has enough weapons in her arsenal to guarantee a nervous breakdown to the entire world's politicians.The author describes her books as: &#34; I have characters prancing around in my head. I have witty dialogue and titillating scenes&#34; And she now has a new 'alien' fan. I am head over heels in love with the idea of Pegramville.I cannot imagine a bigger thrill than hanging out in Buffors Gas and Groceries or Pregramville Caf&eacute;, and getting to meet Miz Demetrice Snoddy, Bubba's mother. Sheriff John Headrick is the man to watch. He's looking for blood - as much as possible, preferably coming from the chopped-off heads of convicted murderers. Add to that the delightful services of Dr. Goodijoint, the coroner, and become a member of the illicit Pegram County Pokerama, and life cannot get more delightful!

He's an interesting character, with some unusual friends, who lives in a town in which most of us would be thrilled not to live.  (Though it does have it's own brand of charm!) The author would seem to be poking fun at the deep south, but anyone who's lived here in a small-town atmosphere knows he's pretty well hit the nail on the head.Bubba is arrested (numerous times) for the murder of his ex-fiance who cheated on him. Knowing that most of the town of Peagramville, Tx has already mentally convicted him (while still liking him) sends Bubba on a quest to find the real killer, accompanied by his faithful basset hound, Precious. His mother, Miz Demetrice, believes in him of course, but then she's nuttier than a fruitcake. Another supporter is the owner/operator of the Red Door Inn, the town's bordello/bed and breakfast.  In the process, he becomes infatuated with the town's new token female deputy, Willodean Gray.Then there is the extra problem of a long line of treasure hunters digging up the grounds of Snoddy mansion looking for the mythical stash of Confederate gold stolen by the late & seldom lamented Colonel Snoddy.  Bubba's family tree is definitely inhabited by a whole lot of squirrels.The entire town and it's residents are a total hoot. The author does a great job of introducing the readers to these folks, and you'll enjoy every one of them. It's a light read while still being a decent mystery.  There's not a lot of suspense or twists and turns, but the warmth and humor replace those well.  I'd say this author has a bright future in the right audience.",Micki

Bubba's a likable character. The character development is good. The abundance of characters can be a bit confusing and overwhelming at times though. The question of who did the deed is laid out there, but the answer is not as obvious as many novels are until closer to the end, which is nice. The writing style can be a bit drawn out and slow at times making you want to skip pages, but the storyline itself keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens to poor Bubba next and who really did the deed. There are some grammatical and spelling type errors, however, they are not overly abundant or so in your face annoying that it's disruptive to the overall reading. With a little more editing and some fine tuning on the writing style, I would have give this book four stars without a doubt. Less drawn out explanations and detail and overdone dialogue, and I might have even given it five stars. But, for the price...it is a good read and worth the time.

I liked the colorful characters, and REALLY small town life was depicted fairly well.  Bubba was by no means average.  He did not approach things in an average way, and it was entertaining to see how he, Deputy Gray, and Precious went about investigating the crimes.  I found several areas of this book to be laugh out loud funny, and I am now glad that I finished this one.  That is where my good news ends.  This book started VERY slowly for me.  I had difficulty getting through the first several chapters, and although I have always been able to finish ""tough-read"" books, this was the first time that I put it down, walked away for a few days, and had to convince myself to go back to it.  I am glad I did go back to it now, but the first little bit was touch-and-go.  The language/accent assigned in this one might be true to the area (don't know as I am not familiar), but I found it to be cliche and difficult to read.  Then again, I thought that there were several stereotypes in the book, but I did not find that it detracted from the overall story.  I am giving this one 4 stars, because I really did like it in the end.  It says ""I like it"" and I did.  My difficulty in the beginning was far outweighed by my entertainment in the end...LOL.

It is full of stereotypes from Bubba Snoddy's feisty mama who rules not only her own home but also runs the town's ""lady's social"" (the local euphemism for the women's poker get together) to her long time housekeeper who feels free to sass her to the greedy real estate developer who thinks the Snoddy family ""mansion"" would be the perfect location for a super Walm-mart - if he could just get the Snoddys to sell.

This murder mystery has some suspense, but you'll have to stop laughing to notice.  Bubba, friends, family and dog are hilarious and the story as much a vignette of life in a small southern town as it is a mystery.  There is a murder, but it is the characters and their down home dialogue that really make the story, especially Bubba's dog Precious.  Bubba just finds the body, but to hear the rumors flying around the town you'd think Bubba killed every woman for fifty miles.  Not much happens around here so the folks have to make the most of whatever gossip comes their way.  This is an entertaining story and though there are clues the mystery isn't easy to solve.

In fact, I was up half the night reading, not wanting to go to sleep without finishing it. The main character is Bubba Snoddy, a car mechanic. We find him struggling to man the 24 hour gas station-convenience store where he works, on a night when everyone has called in sick or quit. Bubba once had a brighter future; he was in the Army. But that was before he came home early to find his beloved fiance&eacute; in their bed with his commanding officer, and Bubba was discharged for almost killing the man. Three years later, he lives back at home with his feisty, shotgun-wielding mother and his faithful dog in their crumbling southern mansion. Returning home from his horrendous night at the gas station, he finds the woman he once loved lying face down, a bullet to her back, ten feet from his house. The sheriff quickly takes Bubba in for what he sees as an act of revenge.I loved the small town Texas setting, the almost caricature characters that were lively and very engaging, and I definitely loved the handsome, under-motivated but unexpectedly resourceful and noble Bubba. If you are a reader who enjoys the well-crafted mystery with the light touch and the comic relief, this novel is for you. You will find no angst, gore, child abuse, dark brooding characterization; you will find plenty of mystery, characters you'll love, lots of laughs, and a picture of small town life that will have you hankering to take a trip to Pegramville.I definitely recommend this book, and I will absolutely read it again in the future.",Zenaida Crespo

Lacy Butler's ability to heal feels like anything but a gift to the young girl, who uses every means at her disposal to pretend it doesn't exist.Royce Darnell's appearance in Lacy's reclusive world sets off a chain of events that will change the girl's life and capsize Royce's well-ordered, carefully planned existence. How can he make Lacy see God in her gift? How can he convince her the healing in her hands is, indeed, a gift--not a curse?There's not a single dull moment as Royce is caught up in desperate measures to save the mining town he loves, the people who live there...and the beautiful mountain girl who has captured his heart. When God reveals to him a solution to Harperville's impending demise, Royce knows he must obey God's gentle nudging, even though that obedience will almost certainly destroy any chance of a relationship with Lacy.Tanya Stowe has created an absolutely believable world peopled with amazing, true-to-life characters who seem almost capable of walking off the page and into a reader's life. She handles the existence of the spiritual gifts with bold faith, calm assurance, and a tender touch of her own. Lacy's struggle to accept her ability as a gift God expects her to give back to Him by using it His way will undoubtedly raise a number of questions in the minds of readers who might never before have considered the possibility of divine gifts being bestowed upon mere human beings.I loved this book, and can say in all honesty that it is one of the best I've read in the past year...and possibly longer.

As nervous about how she'll react as about how he'll look, he reluctantly agrees.Things start out slow, with a fairly routine photo shoot that proceeds from casual to softcore sexy. The wife is a bit of an enigma here, pushing things forward, but also appearing reluctant or uncertain herself. This leaves poor hubby to take responsibility for his own participation, and to acknowledge the fact that he not only wants to keep going, but is enjoying it. By the time the hunky lighting assistant steps into the scene, and the photographer asks if he'd stand next to hubby to demonstrate the contrast between them, you kind of know where the story is going.

It is about Cristabel, who is taken captive by one pirate only to be rescued by another.  Set during the War of 1812, this pirate tale is entwined with that of political intrigue and traitors.

There are no dainty girls who never snort or get drunk. I liked the fact that she brings the every day life events into the book, like a hormonal woman during her monthly cycle, a broken tooth that needs an emergency visit to the dentist, the simple act of changing your contact lenses or a kid waking up in the middle of the night wanting to be cuddled.  This book was very realistic and very well writtenThe author delves in very delicate subjects that unfortunately happen more often than we know. Child abuse, being overlooked simply because of the social status of the abuser. Today's economy taking its tow on businesses.This book felt like a roller coaster. One minute I was laughing and the next I was crying. I literally felt my heart flutter several times and more than once I had to stop reading to clear my vision. I haven't read a romance this good in a while.The parallel story of Jondi, Vory and Thorn was a great addition to the book and gave me a little more inside on John's mind.The Bad:Why on earth (and this is for 99% of the romance books out there), the first time the hero says ""I am sorry"" the heroine falls at his feet and forgives him? What happened to the ""You have to work for it""?I understand John, I really do. I understand the reasons behind him hurting Livvy, but honestly, he got off the hook too easily! Although I would probably find him hard to resist too if I was Livvy...Overall, the good is so good and the bad is so insignificant that I would give it 5 stars or more!

38214,B004GB1T68,5,How Sweet it Is!,A3CF4REP8PQML6,"[3, 3]","Well that was quite an emotional rollercoaster ride!This is my first book ever by Inez Kelley and like many others, I decided to read this book based on a lot of good twitter buzz plus the cover is pretty provocative. I had no idea what the story was really about or what to expect and can I say how pleasantly surprised I was by this book.In Sweet as Sin you've got the quintessential, tortured hero for the ages author John Murphy, the woman who grows to love him pastry chef Livvy Andrews and their emotional journey as they fight the monsters real and imagined to make a go of their relationship. One of the most interesting parts of Sweet as Sin was the novel way Ms. Kelley incorporated John's occupation as a famous, best-selling author to tell a story within a story that mirrored John's life and personal struggles as he used his writing as a coping mechanism and at the same time gave us incite into the hero's actions. Above all Sweet as Sin was a story that proves ""That which doesn't kill you - makes you stronger"".I felt so strongly for the hero at one point that I tweeted the author calling her a cruel mistress for forcing poor John and his alter ego Jondi to face the Sophie's choice dilemma. This was a book that had me thinking about it when I wasn't reading it as I went through a gamut of emotions from caring so much and feeling so sorry for the hero for the torture he had endured as a child in one breath to calling him an a$$hole and f*&king; moron in the next breath even though I knew why he was treating Livvy so terribly. John's survival skills run deep and are well honed from years of having suffered unspeakable horrors at the hands of his preacher step-father. As the conditions build and become the perfect storm, John's like a powder keg just waiting to explode and when he does Livvy tries to stand by her man but - a girl can only take so much from the man she loves. Thankfully Livvy believes in John and their love even if it takes him a little longer to come to the same conclusion.This is great emotional love story and because of that it gets the 5 star review.",Amazon Customer
38215,B004GB1T68,5,Everything that's been missing in Contemporary Romance!,ALZ5DIIINSIIX,"[2, 2]","Kelley delivers what so many contemporaries fall far short of. One of the reasons why I have preferred historicals in recent years is the inability of many contemporaries to sustain believable conflict and to achieve deep emotional impact. Romantic suspense has the advantage of serial killers and baddies running around, but straight up contemporaries often end up relying on misunderstandings and secrets in place of real barriers keeping hero and heroine apart. Kelley deftly avoids these common traps, and Sweet as Sin is a rare gem--a sexy, weepy, funny, gut wrenching, intense read. If it were a baked good, it would be front and center in heroine Livvy's bakery, The Sugar Shack. Readers of Jodi Picoult and Anita Shreve who usually stick to deep women's fiction will find plenty to enjoy here, as well as Contemporary fans starving for something a little meatier.At first glance, Sweet as Sin is your basic oil-and-water Neighbors-to-lovers story. Sunny, upbeat, bakery owner Livvy meets her new neighbor, the dark and broodingly handsome, ""Master of Monsters,"" YA author, John Murphy, in one of the best meet-cute and opening hooks ever. However, thanks to a deeply tortured hero, it transcends the basic neighbors trope to achieve something far deeper. Like another great neighbor story, Susan Kay Law's incredible The Paper Marriage, a seemingly insurmountable barrier to HEA suffuses the novel with a near-palpable sense of longing.The first half of the novel slowly builds this up as we peel away the layers of mystery surrounding Murphy. Even if, like me, you generally prefer a faster pace, stick with it as Kelley makes sure that every single scene has a reason and purpose that is revealed in the second half of the book--even quiet little scenes have huge impact later on, leading up to one of the most devastating black moments ever.The ""villains"" of the story are Murphy's considerable personal demons. Murphy doesn't just write about Monsters--he lives with them in his head, and Kelley navigates a delicate path between mental illness and deeply tortured eccentric with creative coping skills. Without giving away any spoilers, I love that Kelley never gives him an easy way out, even in the end--there's no magic bullet solution for Murphy and his problems don't miraculously disappear just because he gets some ridiculously hot lovin' from Livvy.Kelley manages to lighten up what could be an even darker tale with little touches of humor. The secondary characters help balance out Murphy and Livvy and several interesting subplots. Several smoking hot love scenes are also lightened with a little humor, and the emotions infusing these scenes tremendously added to their impact (and also give them broader appeal as nothing is gratuitous).This book represents everything that's been missing from the contemporary genre, and Kelley is a remarkable talent, one who is certainly on my auto-buy list now. Kelley seems to write from deep in her heart, and this will resonate with a broad spectrum of readers. I simply could not let go of this story--I immediately read it cover to cover a second time, and Murphy is going to stick with me for a very long time.",Annabeth Albert
38216,B004GB1T68,5,Sweet As Sin by Inez Kelley,A1W5WDICY81WQ3,"[18, 18]","Livvy has a new neighbor - a very sexy new neighbor. John is an author writing a very popular young adult fantasy series that he also illustrates. But he has been having writer's block for the past month. Once he meets Livvy, the words start to flow. John grew up with an extremely abusive step-father and has many, many demons. He uses his writing and illustrating as an outlet. When he meets Livvy, their attraction is very immediate. They find this love together, but the demons do not always let the love smile upon them.Livvy owns a bakery and when she meets John she decides it is time for her to have a passionate summer love affair. But she soon learns, that there is nothing easy going about John and her heart falls hard and fast.I wish I could portray the amount of emotions I went through when reading Sweet As Sin. The depth of John really amazed me in this book. When you first read it - John is this really sexy neighbor who finds Livvy's bra in his backyard (it blew off the clothesline) and I thought I totally had the book figured out - sexy neighbors will jump in bed together the end. Boy was I wrong. Because a few chapters later I was riveted to my Kindle and couldn't believe what a complex character John turns out to be.He has very dark demons. He is a very, very tormented man. He writes young adult adventure books, with furry little monsters, yet those little monsters are actually his dark, scary childhood rearing its ugly head. His demons present themselves in a variety of ways. From lashing out at Livvy, or at himself, or at his beloved sister. To closing down and not letting anyone near him. Cowering at an unexpected slight touch. There are points where he is SO brutal to Livvy. Yet, he can compartmentalize, pushing those demons to the back and can be a charming, loving human being. Livvy recognizes this from the start (maybe even a little too understanding) and decides she wants to be there for him..through bad and good. Livvy for the most part is an extremely understanding woman. She has a father who had numerous affairs, so her jealousy does come into play, but for a man who she comes to love quite quickly, she is extremely patient when his dark side comes out.Even when John admits to being in love with Livvy, things are not magically better. Love does not cure the demons - his torture is still present, and it is just another reason why I think John is so well written. Bottom line is - John is not always an easy hero to like. But I believed in his pain, I believed in his demons. Therefore, I believed in his actions.I wish the ending resolution would have played out just a little longer. John crosses some big lines, and Livvy trusts him very quickly again. I believe in their love for each other, I just would have wanted a little bit more time for them to evolve back into a serious couple. We also get a glimpse into the wonderful world John writes - it mirrors what is happening in his real life and I really think it adds so much to this story.Sweet as Sin really blew me away. I loved it and I hope it finds its way to you.","A. Schreiner ""smexybooks"""

Most people would jump and pant at the opportunity . . . but pastry-chef, Livvy, knows a dangerous thing when she sees it. And John Murphy is trouble encased in ass-hugging jeans. She's tempted by his wicked smile and flirtatious words . . . but John is clearly not the sort of boy you bring home to mother. He's a one-night-stand dream-boat and a heartbreak waiting to happen for Livvy - because she wants the minivan, white picket fence and a bun in the oven. Livvy wants what her sister Andrea has, a devoted fianc&eacute;e and a march down the aisle.But John is more than just a cock-sure grin. He makes Livvy laugh. He's the young adult author of a new series about lovable monsters that is taking American by storm. He is a protective big brother to his little sister, and the coolest uncle to his nephews . . . and all of this means that Livvy is sure to lose her heart to the one man who is guaranteed to break it.Because John doesn't believe in love. He rejects hope and distrusts affection. He spent his childhood years cowered and beaten, and now as a grown man he still hasn't gotten over the lessons that were crushed into him. John doesn't just write about monsters, he lives with them.`Sweet as Sin' is a new Erotic Contemporary Romance from Inez Kelley . . . and it's incredible.I want to start out by saying that `Sweet as Sin' has hidden depths. The cover and blurb don't accurately reveal just how complicated and compelling this book is. Yes, there is hot sex and a tender romance . . . but I found myself primarily drawn into the characters and their complicated pasts.Livvy is living on a shoe-string budget as she tries to get her pastry business off the ground and profitable. She's also hearing a ticking clock that's only getting louder when her younger sister starts living the dream of kids, marriage and stability. Livvy wants to start settling into life and contentment - but nothing is really going according to plan . . . least of all, her love life. When John Murphy moves in next door Livvy is almost repulsed by her desire for him. Because she knows he's a good time and nothing more; the most she could hope for is a one-night-stand and amicable neighbourly fallout when their dalliance inevitably ends. Livvy promised herself that she wouldn't fall for such a clear womanizer - her mother did it and struggled with the heartbreak of a cheating spouse for the rest of her life.Livvy struggles and rails against her feelings for John. Regardless, something grows amidst her denial and Livvy discovers John's hidden depths and faded scars. John is not your typical Erotic Romance hero. He's tall, dark, handsome and could tempt a nun to sin. But Kelley has written a lustrous character in John Murphy - he's a man as complicated as he is devilishly delicious.John had a horrendous childhood. Ghosts are still plaguing him well into adulthood and it's only by opening up to Livvy that John is able to recognize how raw his old wounds still are. Now, I loved the romance between John and Livvy - it was playful, tender and sizzling. But more than anything else, I loved how complicated it was.`Sweet as Sin' is not your typical fairy-floss erotica read. This is not a story that you can read for a bit of fun and erotic frivolity. Kelley digs deep and serves up a romance that is at once romantic and darkly complex - as Livvy tries to find her way through John's murky past and help him battle his inner monsters.The novel isn't all doom and gloom. I found myself smiling and laughing out loud a number of times, and I was oddly surprised by how erotic Kelley makes pastry.But the real show-stopper of `Sweet as Sin' is John and his tumultuous past. I found myself equal-parts flabbergasted, horrified and angered by John's revelations - the shocks about his past are as much a rollercoaster as his and Livvy's romance and it made `Sweet as Sin' a far fuller and fulfilling read.Inez Kelly has written a heartbreaking and scorching contemporary romance erotica in `Sweet as Sin'. Enjoy the sex and romance, but read it for the disturbing and enthralling journey that Kelley has written for one of the most endearing characters you will ever encounter.","Dee18 ""dee"""
38220,B004GB1T68,5,Loved it!!!,A8BE8Q59EXJCS,"[4, 4]","Don't let the title of this book fool you. This isn't a sweet and playful read. The story is dark, tough and unforgiving - and I loved every punch it threw at me.John Murphy is a man tormented by his past. A bestselling young-adult author, he writes dark and frightening fantasy books about monsters where good always triumphs and hope can be found behind the darkness. What no one - except his sister Gina - knows is that those monsters are very real in his mind and hope has no real place in his life.Pastry chef Livvy Andrews, John's new neighbor, isn't anything like his usual one-night stands and he knows better than to start any kind of relationship with her. He can't resist flirting with her, though. Livvy figths the attraction, sensing that John carries a heavy emotional baggage inside him. She's got her own baggage to carry and doesn't need the heartache that will be waiting for her if she gets involved with him. Nonetheless, involved with him she gets, even though she knows he isn't looking for forever or anything close to that. What she doesn't know is how to prevent herself from falling in love with him and how to protect her heart from the onslaught of his inner monsters when they rear their ugly faces.I loved this book! Its title - yes, I was fooled by it - and its first pages made me think I was in for a nice and easy sexy read. Even though John was described as a man ""tormented by nightmares"" in the book description, his first appearances in the story led me to believe that his ""torment"" would be nothing more than a plot device designed to add some conflict to what seemed to be a fun story about a summer fling that eventually turns into love. John was cocky and flirty, with just a hint of darkness and secrecy in his eyes to make him dangerously appealing to Livvy - and to the readers too, of course. As the story progressed, the walls he'd built around his heart and his inner monsters started to crumble and I realized that I'd been completely mistaken in my first impression of the book and, for that matter, John.Indeed, this read was anything but nice and easy once John's secrets were revealed. He was definitely a tortured and broken hero, traumatized by his past and imprisoned by guilt. His journey towards recovery wasn't an easy one and Ms. Kelley didn't give him a miraculous ""cure"" in the end, for which I was very glad. Not that I enjoyed seeing John suffer, but you know what I mean.Compared to John, Livvy's life was a walk in the park, but she had problems of her own too. Having witnessed her father cheat on her mother for as long as she could remember, Livvy had some trust issues and was rightfully wary of John at first. On the professional front, her business was struggling to overcome the economic crisis: she was still in the black, but she needed to come up with something new to boost her revenue if she wanted to keep it that way. Little did she knew how much those problems would ultimately be used by John to hurt her... Oh boy, how I wanted to hurt him back for that! At the same time, I didn't want to hurt him either because I could see the reason behind his actions. I think Ms. Kelley's writing was great in the way she showcased John's inner turmoil. She made John call Livvy *blip* (Amazon's rules prevent me from posting what he said) and while I gasped in shock, I felt he didn't mean to say it. It takes some skills to write that without killing my sympathy/empathy for a hero.John and Livvy had a sizzling chemistry and their love scenes were steamy hot. Based on their first encounter, I thought John and Livvy would jump into bed at lightning speed. Once again, I was mistaken - and not the least unhappy about it. Livvy's wariness about getting involved with John gave them the time they needed to know each other and made their first time together mean something more than the mere beginning of a summer fling. Not to mention, there's nothing like some sexual tension to keep the heart beating. :)I found Ms. Kelley's writing very engaging, emotionally speaking, and I really liked the way she's inserted passages of the book John was writing into the story. John's book was as compelling and dramatic as his life. In fact, his book was a reflection of his life and provided an interesting insight into his feelings. Having said that, I must add that the way it was written, the epilogue didn't fully satisfy me. Don't get me wrong, I liked it and it gave closure to the story, but I wanted to see more of John and Livvy.This was my first read by Ms. Kelley and I don't need to say I was very pleased to ""meet"" her, do I? :) (Uh-oh, did you hear that? It was the sound of my Wish List groaning in anticipation of the addition of Ms. Kelley's backlist, LOL.)","Dina ""Dina"""

He's sexy and clearly interested in his new neighbor but Livvy isn't in the market for a bad boy fling. She owns her own home, owns a successful bakery and she's ready for a serious relationship that might lead to marriage, babies and the white picket fence.John Murphy doesn't just have the sexy bad boy thing going for him. He's an author of a popular Young Adult urban fantasy series. He seems fairly easy to figure out on the surface: sexy, smart, interesting, and did I mention sexy? The chemistry between Livvy and John is off the charts and when John turns up the charm Livvy finds it difficult to resist the thrill of a wild summer fling. Throwing caution to the wind they go for it promising to keep it fun, with no strings attached.I've read a few titles by Inez Kelley and really enjoyed her stories and so I was really looking forward to reading Sweet As Sin. I like this author's voice and when I have the chance to read one of her books I jump at it. As much as I've enjoyed Ms. Kelley's other works, I have to say Sweet As Sin caught me totally by surprise. I expected a fun, sexy romance and got so much more.The emotional depth of the characters in this book was extraordinary, taking me on an emotional roller coaster that had me clinging to my e-reader one minute and wanting to toss it across the room the next. John comes off as a cool, sexy bad boy but he is so tormented and complex it made my heart ache. He is not the perfect romance hero by any means. His actions were atrocious at times, making me cringe, but because of the raw pain and torment he suffers as a result of his past I found his actions to be so believable and painfully authentic. John battles his darkness on a daily basis and has learned to cope by creating the monsters in his books. His monsters are a reflection of him really added so much depth to John's character.Livvy has a few of her own demons from the past and at times I wondered if her devotion to John would or should waver. She so fell hard for him in a fairly short amount of time, but she went into the relationship knowing it was to be only a fling. When the heavy stuff started to surface she dug in her heels and was in for the long haul. She seemed to see the light in John where he could only see the dark.I know I'm making this story seem very dark and it is. But it's also fun, sexy and incredibly romantic. This is a fantastic love story that stayed with me for quite some time after The End. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to John and Livvy, and I need a follow up novella NOW.","Fiction Vixen ""Fiction Vixen Book Reviews"""

John Murphy is a man so tortured by his past that he hides behind the characters of his books to avoid human relationships.  He believes he is damaged goods and only brings bad things to the people he loves.Livvy is intrigued with her new neighbor but knows he's not the picket fence type of guy.  Her sister convinces her to let loose and have a summer fling with him, little does she know she's going to lose her heart to him.  The more she is around him; the more she is convinced he's the guy for her.There are so many things about this book I loved.  The main characters are complex and take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride.  The book only has a few secondary characters but they add to the story not distract from it. They are essential to the story and help us understand John and Livvy.John is a writer of a children's series about two monsters that are best friends.  They kept him sane through his childhood trauma, today they are his salvation.  Growing up, he would tell his sister stories to distract her from everything going on in their lives.  The monsters play an integral part in the story and help you see John in a different light.Livvy owns a cupcake store that specializes in erotic confections.  She has done well for herself and vows to never be like her mother.  She needs to find something to propel her business to the next level and comes up with a new edgier, line.  She ends up hurting the one person she loves the most.One of my favorite scenes takes place at her cupcake store and involves some of her cupcakes. I will have a hard time eating cupcakes again without remembering this scene.  In my other favorite scene, Livvy lets her claws out and surprises John with her spirit.  There are so many special moments between John and Livvy that touched my heart.This book took me through every emotion you can think of, there were some parts that I laughed out loud and others with John that I just wanted to hold him tight.  Overall I loved everything about this book and the emotional journey it took me on.  I give Sweet as Sin 5 Flaming Hearts.","Heather Brewer ""Heather"""

It's an extremely emotional story with a tortured hero who's right up there with Zhadist (JR Wards Black Dagger Brotherhood) in terms of a hero who tugs at my heartstrings.The major flaw in this romance--for me--was that the hero was just too believable.  I bought into his issues hook, line and sinker and as a result I can't buy the couples HEA.  The hurt he caused was too great and while the couples make-up scene was believable (even though stupidly contrived) I can't help but think it's a pattern that will repeat itself over and over again.It sounds like I hated the book but I didn't.  I actually enjoyed it.  Even with the niggles that kept causing me to put the book down in the beginning and the HEA I can't really buy into I still recommend this story.",Honeywell
38224,B004GB1T68,4,Very Emotional! Two Hanky Alert.,A2BRAUQW0M47DQ,"[1, 1]","I LOVE emotional reads that get under your skin and don't let go.  Seeing people who have gone through horrible things and made it through to find happiness are my kind of inspirational read.  Inez Kelly is one of those writers who makes their readers a part of these emotional journeys and Sweet as Sin delivers in the intensity of that emotional journey.The journey to true happiness is incredibly rocky for these two.  John came from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his preacher father and still carries the scars today inside and out.  Through his YA and fantasy writings he uses his characters as a form of therapy.  Showing excerpts of these stories is an unique and intriguing way to show us his inner emotions since it's hard for him to express things out loud.  Unfortunately his writings aren't enough as he still has nightmares and rage and alcohol issues.  When he goes through these episodes he's a different man, a very unlikable one.  He lashes out and says hurtful things and it's hard reading these scenes.  Seeing his daily struggles made me ache for him even as I was despising his actions.  He's a good man deep down and deserves to find a woman who can help him heal.  I love wounded heroes and John is definitely that.  He's also charming and super sexy.  Which is part of the reason why Livvy is drawn to him.Livvy is a very strong and independent woman and just what John needs.  She's not going to let him push her away no matter how hard he tries.  She'll stand by him as he struggles to put the past behind him.  She too had a rough childhood with a cheating father which adds to the rockiness of their relationship.  Both John and Livvy had to grow up before their time and it's this shared emotional past that makes their connection so intense and vital to each of them.The sexual interludes in this story are steamy and nicely spaced throughout the story.  Even when they hit a rocky patch the sex is still intense between them.  The ups and downs between them are realistic and made me feel like I was on that emotional roller coaster with them.  Everything happening between them drew me in and I was rooting for them every step of the way.This story was intense from the very first page and didn't let up until the very end.  These were two scarred souls destined to be together.  Livvy was an immensely likable character who was a pillar of strength for John and is the epitome of what a heroine should be.  John was damaged to his very core and after having countless women knew that Livvy was the one worth changing his ways for.  He knew he needed more in-depth help and found it because of Livvy's love and support.  It takes a strong man to admit that and it made me love him even more than I did at the start of the story.  Inez Kelly has created a story with a memorable couple that pulls at your heartstrings and stays with you long after the final page is turned.  Those looking for a story full of emotional ups and downs need look no further than Sweet as Sin.  Just make sure to have a tissue or two nearby.","J. Faltys ""Joder"""
38225,B004GB1T68,5,"Take your breath away, romance!",AAT3IB7EHQNWV,"[1, 1]","I absolutely devoured this book and loved every minute of it! The hero, ""John,"" is a hot, flirty, ex-construction worker, who quits his job to become a widely popular young adult fantasy book writer. (Although, most people don't know it as he writes under a different name.)The heroine, ""Livvy,"" happens to be his beautiful, ginger-haired neighbor, which is convenient, but Kelley's excellent writing makes it completely believeable. Once John and Livvy meet, sparks ignite and they experience instant attraction. However, knowing he has many demons from a terrifying childhood, John simply cannot make any commitments. Livvy decides to give it a go through a little encouragement from her younger sister, who points out it wouldn't kill her to have a summer fling. Still uneasy about her choice and the extra emotional cost of being with her next door neighbor, Livvy reluctantly falls head over heels in love.The twist and turns of this story were truly an emotional roller-coaster, but the ride is oh, so sweet! The difficulties they face together and apart are what made the story for me! John's fictional characters intertwine with his reality and the excerpts provided to the reader, explain his tormented childhood even more. Livvy's love is foreign to John's ""love 'em and leave 'em,"" relationship philosophy, which to his surprise, he's beginning to like...a lot!I loved this book and actually wish there were a sequel. The development of each character was exceptional and a perfect compliment to this wonderfully written love story. Ms. Kelley, you are definitely on my radar!!Update: Once you've finished this book, Kelley has an interview with John and Livvy, three years into the future. It probably should have been included as an epilogue in her book, but that's fine, I'm including it here for you to enjoy later! Have fun!![...]",L Fear

Livvy is not usually attracted to bad boys but she cannot seem to help herself John makes it clear that he does not do long term or commitment, Livvy's sister urges her why not go with it and have some fun, but Livvy is hesitant what if it turns bad he is her neighbour.

38228,B004GB1T68,5,"If I could award this more than 5 stars, I would!",A576L6YAOW6IP,"[3, 3]","My emotions still haven't settled down from the overload that Sweet as Sin subjected them to. My first encounter with Inez Kelley's writing came about when I picked up her erotic contemporary novella Lipstick on His Collar which instantly shot her right into the list of authors that I absolutely must look out for. Even then, somehow I missed out on the fact that this was out until I saw someone on Goodreads who has read this story and fell head over heels in lust and in love with the book. And that is exactly what happened to me when I opened this sinful goody and delved into the very wonderful and beautiful story Inez Kelley has brought to life, that touched something deep inside of me & still refuses to let go.John Flannigan Murphy is the son of a hooker and never knew his father. When Reverend Alan Warner marries John's mother and decides to ""save"" her from herself and the world of sin, John's life takes a turn for the worse when his mother dies succumbing to breast cancer. From 11 years of age till he had turned 16, John had borne the brunt of his stepfather's hatred towards him and the constant physical and emotional abuse which had known no bounds. Protecting his half-sister Gina at all costs had been their mother's dying wish which John fulfills too well when he is sentenced to serve time for manslaughter. Now a young adult fiction author who goes by the name of J. B. Flannigan, John is a tormented soul who lives at the very edge of the destructive path he has chosen for himself until he meets his new neighbor who manages to worm her way into his heart and other emotions which has no place in his life; until there is no place to run or hide from how feels.Sexy, beautiful and vibrant pastry chef Livvy Andrews, owner of Sugar Shack knows from the first moment she lays eyes on the ruggedly handsome John Murphy with his deep navy blue eyes; a man she knows is made for hard work, hard play and heartache right in that very order, Livvy's instincts are dead on when the first thing she wants to do is bolt and stay as far away from her delectable new neighbor as possible. But Livvy's fascination for a man who makes her feel things that she has never ever felt before by just merely fastening his blue-eyed gaze on her propels her towards John and his lethal brand of seduction like a moth to flame and before she knows it, Livvy is hopelessly ensnared and head over heels in love with John against her better judgement as well as that of others who are close to her.John's only intention when he meets Livvy is to have a hot and heavy affair with her until their explosive affair runs its due course. But his best laid plans go all awry when his 38 year old heart begins to hope for the very first time in his life for things that John has long since decided he is not worthy of, and to him Livvy signifies everything that he doesn't deserve right from the cinnamon colored curls on the top of her head to her delectable toes and every inch in between that tempts him unlike anything else has in his life.Piece by piece, with the help of Gina, Livvy begins to piece together the complexity of the man she has fallen for, and is determined to stay beside regardless of whatever John might throw her way to run from the depth of the feelings that develop and overwhelm both of them within such a short span of time. And it is a battle that Livvy almost succeeds in winning until John throws in her face the one thing from her past that would serve as the deal breaker, breaking her heart and very soul in the process.Told from both Livvy and John's points of views, the story that unfolds right along with the sizzling attraction between John and Livvy is of the kind that you wouldn't want to put down even for a moment. Inez Kelley certainly pulls no punches with this one, whether it be the intense connection that springs up between John and Livvy from day one to details of John's past that are horrifying and heartbreaking to even think of. The side characters are well developed lending a rich feel to the emotionally gut-wrenching story that takes place which left me reeling from the intensity of each and every emotion that coursed through me.Protectiveness for a boy who learnt to fight his battles from day one and learnt to deal with the evil side of life with his talent for spinning a dark tale to keep the monsters away, surged deep within me and am sure every reader that has picked up this book would feel the same way. I hurt and bled for John as I read along, wanting to love him, to brush the lock of hair that tends to fall on his forehead aside and place a kiss right there and cherish him for everything he has been and everything he is and so much more. Livvy's character is so very endearing and so beautiful inside and out, and exactly what John needs to face his demons and lay his past to rest, because he deserves nothing less.There are no magical solutions to ANY of the problems discussed at length in the novel which makes it one of the utmost favorite erotic contemporary romances I have read to date. The characters from John's stories lend something extra to the story giving it an edge that certainly makes one sit up and notice Inez Kelly's ability to spin a tale worth re-reading from time to time. I think I can go all night long rehashing what made this story work for me and why I would recommend it to every single person I know, because yes, it is that good. And I couldn't have asked for more in a hero, a heroine or the very well done love scenes of the wicked and tender variety that took place leaving me hungry for more of the same from the author. If this is what Inez Kelley can do with a full length novel, I say bring it on! I would be one of the first ones to queue up to buy the book - even if it were to be sold in the remotest corner of the world.Reviewed by: Maldivian Book Reviewer","maldivianbookreviewer ""Book Reviews - From th..."

There was a lot of buzz on twitter and rave reviews that had my interest piqued.John Murphy is a writer. There are demons from his past that he can not shake. Livvy owns a bakery shop. Her little sister is getting married and Livvy's clock is steadily ticking away. When Livvy meets her new neighbor, John, the attraction is instant. Livvy decides, on the advice of her sister, to have a fling with her handsome neighbor. John is more than willing to oblige; he's the fling expert. He doesn't do relationships. But the more John and Livvy are in each other's company, the idea of just a fling melts away.Sweet as Sin is an intense read. John is a very dark and wounded man. What happened to him as a child has forever marked him; literally and figuratively. He tries to keep the darkness at bay but the more he's around Livvy and his feelings for her change, he lashes out.  There are times where John is so cruel to Livvy that I cringed while reading the scene. He can be a truly unlikable character. But John is also a caring person. We see glimpses of that when he's with his nephews and his sister. He's loving and protective. He is open to their love. John never expected to fall in love with Livvy. He didn't want love and doesn't think he is deserving of love. He feels like his love is poisonous. Usually, when  declaration of love is made, things get better. Not for John and Livvy. The demons that John tries to hide rise to the surface. Livvy wants to be there to help him and support him but John pushes her away with cruel words and actions.Livvy is a wonderful, strong female character. I loved how she wouldn't let John go without a fight. She was willing to stick by his side and fight with him. When John was mean and cruel, instead of tucking tail and running away, Livvy pushed back and fought for him and their relationship. There were times where John went way over the line. When this happened, Livvy still maintained her dignity and strength.Sweet as Sin is an emotionally charged and powerful story. There are sexy and sensual moments throughout the book but the majority of the plot is dark and gritty. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows for John and Livvy. Their journey is not pretty and it's not easy. They have to get past some huge emotional hurdles before they are both truly healed.Have a box of tissues nearby. You're going to need them!","M.

John, Livvy's new next-door neighbor, is only familiar with one-night stands, and that's all he thinks he is capable of. Livvy and John are attracted to one another, and they begin a no-strings summer fling. Will their fling lead to love? Or are John's monsters and their different visions of the future too much of a hurdle?This adult contemporary novel was intense. It was heartbreaking, sweet, emotional, sexy, dark, fun, and again INTENSE! I had a few teary-eyed moments and a few laughs while reading this novel. Personally, I thought this book had a great balance between the sweet and the dark; it had just enough of each.Livvy and John are well-developed characters. I really understood Livvy and her reluctance to repeat her mother's mistakes. Surprisingly, I also really understood John. He is a strong, but tortured character. I am not personally familiar with the hardships he faced in his adolescence, but Kelley does a wonderful job of showing you his emotional journey. Even thought he makes decisions throughout the novel that I, personally, would not make, I understood why HE made those decisions because I understood his character.One of my favorite things about Sweet as Sin was the incorporation of John's young adult book series. The characters in his book series represent his soft side, his dark side and his battle between the two. His characters really helped me understand him better. It was a brilliant and unique way of letting us into John's mind.I gave Sweet as Sin by Inez Kelley 4 STARS (3.5 STARS). I recommend this novel to adults looking for an intense, emotional, and sexy novel. If you are in the mood for something light & fluffy then you should hold off on this novel. Wait and read this one when you are in the mood for something all-consuming! This book reminded me a lot of Unwritten Rules by M.A. Stacie. Personally, I liked Sweet as Sin better because I related to the characters in Kelley's novel better.

38237,B004GB1T68,5,Really just a good all-around read...,A23GRXCXQU3SM8,"[0, 0]","My Review:This is a book that has been on my radar (and quite honestly, on my Kindle) ever since it came out because everyone absolutely RAVES about how good it is. Honestly, I am not sure what I expected from this book, but I will readily admit that it surprised me...and I can't even pinpoint how, but this book was not what I expected...and that is not a bad thing.Everyone talks about how emotional this book is and it most definitely is that because John has a LOT of emotional baggage. But if you have read my reviews much, you will know that I cry in a LOT of books (and usually you get an A+ review from me if you make me cry,) but I really didn't in this one. There was only a single moment where I even came close...the final scene in John's book that he's writing.What I did find in this book though was a ton of humor (and I wasn't expecting that.) The dialogue and wittiness between Livvy and John leaps off the page with their chemistry. I loved it when these two would talk...it was just pure magic watching the dialogue between them.But there is also a TON of sadness to this book. John is scarred...deeply and heavily in his soul by an extremely abusive stepfather until he was 16 yo. Those scars affect how he deals with absolutely every aspect of his life. In fact, it is those scars that he writes about. He's a YA author who write a series about two monsters, Jondi and Thorn. Those monsters have protected him and given him a safe place to escape to his entire life. Now John's life is being turned upside down in so many ways, but mainly through his love for Livvy, that he can't accept, and even his monsters in his stories are turning on him.It is a good book. I definitely enjoyed every minute of reading it. Livvy is strong and powerful and she believes in her love for John. I liked the fact that no matter how bad things got, neither one of them ever debated their love for the other and Livvy's move at the end, was simply brilliant to get John to see the truth of what she was saying. Everyone who says that you should read this book, is absolutely correct. I am so glad that I finally listened.",Smitten with Reading
38238,B004GB1T68,4,Sweet as Sin reviewed by The Book Vixen,A14ZYUOM6A8LY4,"[2, 2]","4 and 1/2 starsWhy I Read this Book: Sweet as Sin is a book I read specifically because it was recommended to me as a `great emotional read'. If I were to have come across this book on my own and read the blurb, truth be told, I probably wouldn't have picked it up and I would have seriously missed out - big time. Huge! Like the ladies in that Rodeo shop that turned Julia Roberts down in Pretty Woman HUGE. I love me a good emotional read (it's why I read Nicholas Sparks' novels) so I jumped on this like it was the last train coming out of the station.What I Liked: The characters in Sweet as Sin felt so real and raw. John is quite a complex character. He's a broken soul that comes from a tormented past. He's so far broken that the shattered pieces still need to be put back together. He's seems simple at first but once Livvy gets to know him, he's tough to crack. I found myself constantly wondering if Livvy was going to give up on him.I love, love, LOVE how the author incorporated John's YA novel into this novel. The connection was powerful, seamless and, for me, an important facet to the main storyline. It was brilliant!Sweet as Sin is a deep and intense read. No light reading material here. You'll be completely engaged the whole time through. I was reading this one during my daily treadmill workout and let me just tell you how hard and awkward it was to be crying while on the treadmill. And I'm not talking about stray tears here. Full blown on sobbing people.What I Didn't Like: I'm an epilogue fanatic. For most of the romance novels I read, I look forward to (and need) an epilogue. I need that final bit of closure for the main characters. It's nice to know that they get their HEA but I need to know how they're doing in the future. In Sweet as Sin, there's an epilogue but I wasn't satisfied with what I got. It was an interesting epilogue but I didn't get the closure I needed. I would have liked to have seen what was actually in the epilogue put at the end of the last chapter (because it was good to know how that story arc ended as well as the main story did) and the epilogue give me what's going on a few years from where the story left off.Overall Impression: Sweet as Sin is the first book I've read by this author. Inez Kelley blew me away with this book. Have the tissues ready when you pick up Sweet as Sin. There are demons (of the metaphorical kind), broken characters and lots of emotional issues and baggage in this one. Like I mentioned, I love good emotional reads; it's why I read Nicholas Sparks novels. But one thing this book had that Sparks' books don't is love scenes. Hot, sweltering love scenes.",The Book Vixen

John is a tortured soul, emotionally scarred so deeply, by an extremely abusive stepfather. Those scars rule every aspect of his life. So much so that he is unable to have any form of long-standing relationship except with the sister he has always protected.John is an author who writes a series about two monsters, Jondi and Thorn. These monsters came to life when he was a child trying to safe-guard his sister, telling her the stories late at night to help her (and himself) escape the fears and hurt from the mental and physical abuse they both suffered.

Until he moves next door to Livvi and everything changes....Livvi is an extremely talented pastry chef and owner of the specialty bakery; the Sugar Shack.

I asked Jenny to remind me of this cause I might forget. I DID NOT forget. It was the first place I went as soon as I'd finished..because I NEEDED to know.

38240,B004GB1T68,5,Sweet,A1JKGTL51HHTU1,"[4, 4]","Sweet as SinReviewed by Ann & posted at Under The Covers Book BlogSWEET AS SIN starts off with John Murphy, a successful YA writer walking over to his neighbour's home to return a scarlet demi bra that flew into his yard on a gust of wind. Naturally, the lingerie catches his attention and causes erotic fantasies to fly and rumble around in his head.I had a similar experience as this, though mind you, mine involved hot pink panties instead of the scarlet demi bra but I can tell you my story didn't end up as fabulous or as delicious as John's trip to his neighbour's.Why, I must ask. Why does this only happen in books? Inez Kelley, please rewrite the pages of my life so that THIS happens in it.""Yeah, it's a neighborhood tradition. Come over. Bring your wife and kids.""A twitch danced along his upper lip before he grinned. ""Can't. Don't have either.""Livvy lowered her brows. A shiver slid along her skin and she fought the shake. He was far too cocky to encourage. ""Then bring your girlfriend.""""No girlfriend to bring.""""Bring your boyfriend then.""A bark of a laugh rumbled out. ""Sorry, honey, you're just stuck with me.""""I don't want you,"" she snapped.John leaned close. The scent of sunshine, man and power wrapped around her. ""Maybe I want you.""*shivers*But I digress.In all seriousness, this book was a fantastic read that captured my heart from the beginning and never let go until the very end. I read this book in one night with tears running down my cheeks. This from an author I have never read before and had no expectations of. Inez caught me by surprise and I can tell you that she has gained a new fan out of me.SWEET AS SIN follows Livvy, a pastry chef and the dark and tortured writer, whose past still haunts him daily. I didn't expect the emotion that Kelley evoked from me. Touched by the love that developed between Livvy and John and heart-broken when things began to shatter for them, this book took me on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I didn't think I could come to love and hate a character in equal measures. John Murphy is an extraordinary character that really came to life. Even as his outbursts caused me to step back a little, I still loved him. I can't remember the last time a character felt so alive for me.And then there is Livvy who has a heart made of gold and a spine made of steel. What she endures in this book to be with John is hard but magical. In those steps, she is able to go from a reluctant lover who needed some urgings from her sexy neighbour to a woman in love, someone willing to fight for it all.This isn't an easy read, there are some really dark places that this book delves into, but if you are looking for a tortured hero, then look no further, no one is as tortured as John Murphy. Similarly, John isn't always the wickedly charming man as I've exampled above. As layers to his character are revealed, other darker sides of him are exposed as well. He says and does some really mean things that I don't think Livvy deserved but he did what was necessary to push her away.

Suffice to say this short novel under 150 pages did not disappoint. Miss Stroud has a great writing style with the POV coming from all her ensemble, so you know what is going on with all of them.Sam Wilson has gotten it right the second time, divorcing the cheerleader Barbie doll first wife, and meeting the love of his life. He has married Jane and they are deeply in love. Enter the ex wife Bambi (yes Bambi), you all know her type, high roller, exquisite, with a black heart. She is the wicked mother of a great son who doesn't deserve any of this, Danny.The title does not tell what the book is about, and you will only `get it' after you read the book. The mystery evolves when Bambi realizes her life is slipping by and she has nothing. Her claim to fame is her beauty, her boobs and her social status, which will all soon be a changing. She is living her life in a bottle of booze and anger, with her unhealthy hatred, and devises a plan to take Jane and Sam down with her.The book is such a quick read as the author takes us down this windy path, during  a month before Christmas. You feel the Holiday spirit of all the cast. Jane's love for the holiday makes every one of her family love it too. She is a bright light for her  husband Sam, her dog Devil and her step son Danny.The hatred in  Bambi permeates the pages, and you are filled with loathing for her. Being in her head, as she rationalizes her feelings is also  hard. She makes some pretty loathsome choices and you are rooting for the good guys.The book was a great read, the only irksome thing for me was the last scene, for Bambi, and I would have liked something more plausible.

I shoulda moved it up long ago and would have if I'd known it was this good.Jane Wilson, her husband Sam, their son Danny and their ugly but lovable dog Devil are getting along just fine in Florida until Sam's ex-wife Bambi shows up, bent on revenge and getting rid of Jane. This psycho from hell is a wonderful character and spices things up nicely. The crude language might be a bit too much for some, but it is perfectly within character and suitable for the context of this novel.The writing is superb -- vintage Stroud -- and the editing first class. I think this woman could make a grocery list seem entertaining. The characters are wellrounded, interesting dialogue and just a damn good read.This one is worth 10 stars if I could give it, but five will have to do. A very well written and creative piece of work.

His ten year marriage to Bambi, a spoiled, self-centered socialite from Tallahassee ended and two and a half years later he marries Jane, and Jane's beloved, big black mix-breed dog named Devil.  Jane is the office manager for a security services company who hates her job as well as her boss.  Bambi is not willing to let Sam off the hook and uses their teen-aged son Danny as leverage. Danny has not accepted Jane in her role as 'Step-mother', and Jane seems to just accept that he never will.The more scotch Bambi consumes, the more devious plots she conjurs up in her mind to disrupt Sam and Jane's lives and hopefully drive a wedge in their marriage.  It is Christmas time and the winter weather of constant rain and cool temperatures lingers for days.  Mysterious events begin occuring around Jane and Sam's home, and Jane is convinced Bambi is behind them.  Sam is convinced she isn't.When Devil disappears, all hell breaks loose.  The mystery deepens with a brutal assault on Jane at an awards ceremony for Danny and some of his classmates at the local country club.

Sure she has the world's worst boss, and a job that sucks, and her relationship with her stepson is not the greatest, but Jane is not going to let those few little problems get her down.Unfortunately, it seems Sam's psycho ex-wife Bambi has decided that it's time that Sam realizes what a big mistake he made in divorcing her, and the only thing standing in her way of getting him back is none other than his current goody two shoes wife Jane. Bambi is not about to let that little plain Jane Sam married get in her way, so she sets her twisted mind on her goal, and heaven help anyone or anything that gets in her way.Jane is unprepared for Bambi's truly sick, perverted methods of vindictiveness, but she is determined to convince Sam that Bambi is evil, and will do whatever it takes to protect those she loves.Having not read any of Ms. Stroud's works, I wasn't sure what to expect with this book.  Ms. Stroud did not disappoint, she managed to pack a lot of content into a short, well written book that was full of surprises around every corner. Her characters are varied and we are given a good glimpse into each of their thoughts and feelings.Jane is a bit of a Pollyanna in the beginning. She loves Sam, is willing to try to make it work with his son Danny and put up with his ex-wife Bambi. She doesn't understand why Danny doesn't like her, and while it bothers her, she isn't going to let it get her down. She knows Bambi is a bitch, and she gets frustrated with Sam when he just won't see her for what she is.The constant bright spot in her life has always been her dog Devil, who is getting old but Jane can't imagine life without him. It doesn't take her long to take off those rose colored glasses of hers, and she becomes one strong woman not to be messed with. Her relationship with Danny is difficult and I'm not sure if a little bit of it isn't her fault and a little bit of it isn't Sam's fault.Sam is a good man, he's a vet and loves animals (a plus for Jane and Devil) but does have blinders on when it comes to Danny and Bambi. I didn't understand why it took him so long to see Bambi for what she really was, but he was such a softy that I forgave him.Danny was your typical teen of divorced parents, trying to fit in somewhere and wanting to protect his mom despite her neglect of him. He was a good kid, he could have used a little less coddling from Sam and little more parental guidance but hey, no one is perfect.Bambi was the perfect villainess. That woman had no sense of morals, and she was pretty sure the world revolved around her. She was just so easy to hate and boy, did she come through and not disappoint in that department.This is a short book and I read it in about 3 hours, but don't be fooled, even though it is short it packs a wallop. Reader be warned, there is some R rated language, some violence and a few scenes of animal abuse, none of it over the top, but if the F word bothers, this might not be the book for you.I'm not sure what it says about me, but I loved every moment. I ran the entire roller coaster of emotions from love, hate, fright and tears and was sad to say goodbye to Jane, Sam, Danny and Devil when it ended. If you like a book with a strong heroine, a real nasty villain and a big ole softy dog, this book is for you.Reviewed as a Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Reviews Team",lovestodive

Rebecca Stroud'sDevil's Moondid that for me.  I opened this book yesterday intending to read 2 maybe 3 chapters, but suddenly found myself a bit over 60% in with a family clamoring for their dinner.  Immediately after doing the serving & clearing up, I sat back down and literally devoured the rest of this story.  It is shorter then King so you can easily finish in a day, his took me a week.The main characters in this book are mostly extremely likeable as well as believable.  They are:Sam- a kindhearted, veterinarian who is also Jane's husband.  This is a second attempt at matrimony for both and a very happy one.Jane- wife of Sam who works at a really crappy job for Randall a basket case, whiner, loser boss, but volunteers at the local animal shelter as well.Devil- Jane's getting older, ugly, but much beloved dog who is embraced by the whole family.Danny- son of Sam and Bambi who I will describe later and is the pretty typical 17 yr old child of divorced parents when one parent is acrimonious and can't move on.  Conflicted and afraid to let his step-mom Jane too far into his life.And then there is Bambi- a foul mouthed southern belle, piece of nasty work who believes the sun rises and sets on her or at least it should.  She cannot cope with having been replaced by Jane as Sam's wife feeling Jane is inferior to her and becomes seriously unbalanced with a severe drinking problem to boot.This story allows us to follow this dysfunctional family through a period of time and watch as one women falls apart and crumbles, yet does not change while the rest struggle to form a cohesive, loving family unit.

40438,B004HO5M4O,4,"Enjoyable, Clean Romance!",A1VME3FLHEV6DP,"[0, 0]","Came across this author while looking for something more romantic and less about graphic sex, lust and vulgarity, that seems to be so prevalent in many Historical romances these days. With mixed reviews, I decided to try it and really enjoyed it!  Instead of the child some reviewed Cherry as, I found a very pleasant, intelligent but pleasantly innocent 19 yo who has a refreshing if slightly naive personality. Actually, I felt she fit the era really well in her fun loving, happy innocence but with a confidence in herself and abilities. She knows what she wants and when she first meets Lobo, she knows he's what she wants and doesn't hesitate to go after him despite her pa's warnings to stay away, when he suddenly appears in town. Is Lobo another outlaw? The whole town thinks he is and he's not talking, so Cherry sets out in her innocent, sneaky fashion to try and learn more about him. Of course he catches her and drags her home by the scruff of her neck to her famous, ex- Texas Ranger pa, telling her she's gonna get herself in trouble she doesn't understand. Her pa gives her a talking to about the reason he keeps her dressed as a boy instead of the beautiful young women she is. There are some local outlaws that frequent their town of Blue water and her pa is afraid what will happen if the outlaws see her for the truly sweet, pretty young woman she is. While Cherry understands her pa's reasoning & goes along with always hiding her true self, she also resents it because outlaw or not, Cherry Ray wants Lobo for her very own. She believes that can never happen if he can never see her for the woman she is but as a boy.  Lobo is all too aware of Cherry's sexuality and finds her penchant for mischief very distracting  from his purpose in coming to town. He's committed and set on his purpose but realizes he's becoming too distracted when he finds himself constantly finding Cherry where she shouldn't be and trying to keep her out of trouble and safe. He finally tries to show her how easily she can be caught but it pretty much backfires on both of them. For me, it's a very entertaining, suspenseful, funny and romantic story. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for good storyline and romance but not for those who prefer the graphic sex and lust. This definitely has the romance and desire with some hot kisses and plenty of temptation that pulls you in but the rest is left for the readers own imagination. Will definitely read more of this author's books!",Debbie

They are of the sweet non-graphic kind.Cherry Ray lives with her father, Arthur Ray, a respected ex-Texas Ranger. She dresses mainly in boy's clothes as her father wants to make her as invisible as possible, especially when it comes to the band of outlaws who regularly visit their town. Ray's wife was shot when Cherry was very young. In order to protect his daughter and make sure that she is not left alone, he has given up his work as a lawman to become a rancher.Cherry is bright and inquisitive; she can outrun and outshoot most men she knows. She loves reading dime books about her heroine Jenny and her beloved sheriff.One day a fascinating stranger rides into town, looking so dangerous that speculation starts as to whether he is there to join the outlaws.Once Cherry actually meets the stranger, Lobo, in a rather embarrassing situation, her life changes for ever. She is quite determined to make him her very own.This is a western romance with a `Bonanza' feel to it.

The hero's sad story serves to make him all that more loveable. The story has a lot of elements that I personally like.  I like people who take their word and responsibilities to others seriously--and will keep their promises in spite of obstacles.  I love stories about lovers who have been separated and find each other again. I love stories about love that doesn't die, even when the lovers cannot be together--and in this case, you get two for the price of one.  I also like that the story has a mean girl--Ms. McClure's mean girls always add so much interest to the story, whether their role is lengthy or brief.

While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader's mind, the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor's eye being run over the text, followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in, and what to remove.  The dialogue feels forced and stilted, and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue, and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling, rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story, of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame, because it could have been such a good book if handled properly.",E.

This was the sequel to October Breezes and it was told from Devin's point of view. I loved that we got to be inside his head this time and we got to see Skye from a different perspective as well. Devin was such a well written character and he was so protective and loyal to Skye it made me love him that much more. His fierce love and devotion to Skye really made a difference in her life and without his presence and friendship I truly don't think she would've ever healed and moved forward with her life. Even though Devin and Skye went to different colleges they managed to keep their friendship alive and I loved being able to see them come together again.This book was frustrating at times because it was hard to watch Skye still having so many issues all these years later. I thought in a way she would've healed a bit more from the time that had gone by, but life doesn't always work that way. There were times I found myself getting frustrated with Skye for something she said or did; then I'd look at how I sometimes tend to emotionally block people out and my way of thinking and I completely understood. Thankfully Devin was an amazing friend and he never gave up on Skye. We should all have one person in our lives like Devin who will always be there for us, to bring us back down to earth and to reassure us when needed. This book made me very thankful for that person in my life who I know I'd be lost without!I loved the ending, don't want to give it away, but I will say that if you liked the first book this one is definitely worth reading.

Summer Sunsets is the AFTERMATH.Summer Sunets, the sequel to October Breezes by Maria Rachel Hooley, continues the story of Skye Williams and Devin Abbott. This story, told in Devin's perspective, picks up years later after Skye and Devin have graduated from separate colleges.In October Breezes Skye battles through many life-altering obstacles, almost losing herself in the process. It was an emotional and heartbreaking suspense novel. Then in Summer Sunsets, Skye is still struggling to accept her past and move forward with her life.  Summer Sunsets is more of a romance, focusing on finding yourself after the storm.Summer Sunsets is a good story, but it isn't as good as October Breezes. Still, I am very glad Hooley continued on with this story. Summer Sunsets illustrates the long-term effects of the tragedies Skye has faced.  This novel also gives us closure by showing us what's to become of Skye and Devin.I gave Summer Sunsets 4 STARS.

In my country, Panama, there is a large black population which follows, even today, the same dynamics described by the author -- racial perfection is determined by whiteness, straighter hair and not necessary by wealth or education.I also appreciated that this book was not written following the current ""political correctness"" in writing or speech.  This added an important flavor of sincerity.As the diaries seemed to have been transcribed, I do not know if the work merits some re-editing for punctuation, especially misplaced commas and substitution by semi-colons.

42097,B004J4W024,4,Olga - A Daughter's Tale,AICMQ5YCG5YNL,"[1, 1]","Olga -- A Daughter's Tale is a story rich with historical and cultural detail, intrigue, and family. It takes place during a very interesting time period in both Jamaica's and England's history. Besides being about family, love, and doing what it takes to get through tough circumstances, this is also a study on the character of people. There are all sorts of people represented in this novel, and it's interesting to see how their actions affect other people, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.However, I don't think the diary format was the best choice for this novel. First of all, the entries weren't dated -- not even a year was given, so I was confused as to when exactly events were taken place. Secondly, there were times when the descriptions or historical information didn't fit in with the voice of the person writing the entries. The benefit of having diary entries is that the reader gets to feel close to the character, and while I felt close to Olga near the end of the novel, I wasn't feeling that connection at the beginning. I think short stories, or even a chapter format would have been better.Despite that, this is a great story. It's both heartbreaking and inspirational. And to know that this is non-fiction and not just a made up story makes it even better. Besides being a quick read (I couldn't put this book down!), it is an inspiring story. I like books that make me think after I've put them down and make me want to learn more about the stuff it brings up. I now have a few books on hold at my library about Jamaica and World War II in England, because I couldn't get them out of my head after reading this book.This is a book everyone can appreciate, because it's about real life. We all have family drama (and Olga certainly has that!), and all our families have their quirks. We have all been in a tough spot at sometime or another, and we have all had to find our way out of that tough spot. That's what at the heart of this novel. One girl's path to becoming a woman, an event that changed her life, and the decisions she made after that. It's beautiful and it makes a good story.

Her sisters soon follow, and younger sister Becky soon creates a bit of a scandal by marrying a black man. Becky has 11 children, and this is where Olga's story begins. Olga is a sweet girl who always wants to be good, but she is a bit naive at times. Her family goes through their own adventures and scandals. Olga goes to England and eventually becomes stranded due to World War II. In England she endures the trials and tragedy of war, along with a few personal problems that occur. Throughout it all Olga remains remarkably resilient and courageous. She is determined to do the best she can at all she does, and she manages to take care of herself even in dire circumstances.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is that it is a true story. The story is told through a series of letters, newspaper clippings, and diary entries. I found this to be a marvelous way to get into the different character's personalities. I enjoyed this way of telling the story. I found it to be an effective way to tell everything that happened without unnecessary amounts of long exposition. There were many topics of great interest to me. Olga's life was made much more difficult by the racism she faced in Jamaica and England. Another very interesting part to me were the descriptions of life in London during the war. You get a feel for how frightening it must have been to try and go on with your life while bombs were falling.I enjoyed this book so much, and it really makes me want to go look into my family history. While I may not have relatives with a life as exciting as Olga's, I certainly think there are stories of interest to me. This book was very interesting and quick to read.

Olga Browney was born and educated in Kingston, the child of a white mother and black father. She and her siblings navigate Jamaica's racial politics and economic crises. In the 1930s Olga travels to England to train in dance, and her life ends up following a path far different from what she expected.There is much that is interesting in this book. The social and racial hierarchies of both Jamaica and England dictate much about people's lives. Browne's discussion of life in Jamaica is beautiful. I really enjoyed her prose. I was definitely engaged by Olga's story.My only real complaint is that I found the format of the book- a series of letters and diary entries- to be somewhat clumsy. I think it would have been better had it simply been written in a straight narrative style. Otherwise I enjoyed this book.",LH422

Marie-Therese (Browne)Campbell  would never had known about her family in Jamaica. A true  story that deals with  prejudice, deceit, cruelty all heaped on women during the war. When  her mother was sick in the hospital if she had died Marie never would have known about the family behind in Jamaica. It's a fast read that  is strictly taken from diaries  not only from her mother  Olga but her great aunt Lucy and her grandmother.As she relates how  the family ended up in Jamaica from England and how her grandmother at that  time married a black man which was highly frowned upon.  Olga goes to England to attend a dance school and live with her Aunt Martha, whom she soon learns is a liar and an alcoholic. With the advent of the war she is unable to  return to Jamaica. When she is raped by an army doctor she did not realize she could get pregnant and that now  ends her  training to be a nurse and she is forced to leave that position.As we follow  the life of Olga who was not about to give up her child, even though she falls on hard times, she manages to send her to a good Catholic Boarding school for a time. In all this time she never writes home as she feels this would bring shame to her family. In the end her daughter Marie places an ad in the Jamaica Paper and after 50 years Olga finally talks once again to her family and Marie now has a connection.This is a powerful story of a close knit family that takes the reader through  the marriages, births of children and the war and how  the family drifts apart as  some moved to the United States .  Through their  family history, their heritage and their culture and how the war and events of that time  separated one  young lady from her entire family. Did Marie ever get to meet her father, No he also moved to the United States and died in an accident, more than likely never knowing he had a daughter in England.If you like Biographical  genre's then I feel you will enjoy this book.

She longs to qualify and return to her family in Jamaica and make them proud of her.Naive, religious, timid, she becomes the victim of a callous encounter, and with an illegitimate child she can no longer be accepted as a nurse. She must find ways and means to support her little girl, and is prepared to endure any humiliation as long as she can give her child a good education. She is too ashamed to let her family in Jamaica learn what has happened to her.Her story is written by her daughter, mainly in diary form.

After reading six books by Katie one thing I have noticed is how diverse Katie is in her stories.  Many times when you read several books by the same author you tend to find the same plot ideas, but Katie does a great job of writing very different stories. In this story we find Adam, who was hired by Izzy's father to watch out for her without her knowing.  He was also supposed to get her to move back home.  In return, Adam's security company was going to land a lucrative contract from Izzy's father. What started out as a job turned into much more. Throw in a serial rapist in the area that is now after Izzy and you have a lot going on in the story.One of the things that kept me from putting down the book wasn't the serial rapist that was on the loose and after Izzy, but Adam and Izzy's relationship.  I kept wondering when he was going to come clean about who he really was. Izzy kept telling herself to trust him and it frustrated me that Adam was lying to her, even if he didn't want to.  I admired Izzy's strength as a woman who wanted to be independent from her father and also how much she cared for her friends. Adam was the typical protective alpha male in the book, but he had to fight with himself so much to figure out the right way to be with Izzy, including when to tell her the truth and how to protect her.  This was a great story from start to finish. If you are looking for an emotional romantic suspense story, I highly recommend this one.",Amy (So Many Reads)

She is tired of her very wealthy father interfering in every aspect of her life. Bartending  is not her dream job, but for now she is happy, and independent - or so she thinks.Unknown to Izzy, her father has hired ex-marine Adam Marcellus to not only keep an eye on Izzy's safety, but to also convince her to move back to her hometown of Savannah, Georgia. If Adam is successful, Izzy's father has agreed to give Adam a big security contract. Adam and his brother have been working so hard to get their security company off the ground. This could just be the break they need. Adam has to start putting the pressure on Izzy, since he only has five weeks to make this happen. When he starts working at her bar, and starts spending time with her, all thoughts of the deal with her dad go out the window. He is very attracted to her and the guilt of lying lays heavy on his shoulders.Izzy has never felt this way about a man. She starts to really enjoy the time spent with him, but outside conflict starts to make her life difficult. There is a sexual predator on the loose in their small town. Izzy is getting prank phone calls, and soon too many things happen to make it a coincidence. Izzy is the next target, and Adam will do anything to keep her safe.Dangerous Secrets is the first book I have read by Katie Reus. I enjoy romantic suspense books and in this one we get a very creepy sexual predator. One where his confidence rises with each girl he captures. When Izzy screws up his plans one night, she becomes his next target, and he starts to become more violent. We get his point of view throughout the book, making him a man that is very scary and repulsive.Adam is one of those southern gentlemen. Always opening the door, always putting Izzy first. He is a man of few words, but his actions speak very loud. He has that low rumble of a laugh, and is very intense in the bedroom. The sex scenes in this book are very hot and plentiful. Hello to sex in the ocean! Adam keeps the secret of being Izzy's guardian for a long time. I felt like the way it played out is very predictable which took away a bit from the ending.I liked Izzy in that she comes from a very wealthy background, and although likes to be independent, once in awhile Adam or even herself catches her falling back into the spoiled,wealthy life she used to live in. It made her seem more real and not so perfect. I didn't love a move she makes at the end resulting in a big conflict, again I felt it to be predictable. But I think the ending resolution with the villain eventually plays out well.Overall though, this is a sexy suspense book and I will definitely be checking out the next in the series.Rating: C+","A.

Sure, money is tight now and then, but going back home to live under her wealthy father's shadow isn't an option that interests her - especially now that her boss has hired tall, dark and handsome Adam to work with her...In order to cinch the multi-million-dollar Forester deal, security expert Adam Marcellus lets Izzy's father convince him to move to Coconut Bay and keep an eye on her - without her knowing his true identity, of course - for five weeks. It's icing on the cake if Adam can convince her to return to Savannah, but as long as he assures her father that she's safe, he will land the Forester deal. He manages to get a job at the same bar she works and is nicely surprised when he meets her and realizes that she isn't anything like the spoiled rich princess he thought she would be.Adam is undeniably attracted to Izzy and vice versa, but he holds himself back because he knows they have no future. Not only he's been lying to her since they met, but he's also learned the hard way that a classy woman like her would never settle down with a straight blue-collar working man like him. When Izzy unwittingly crosses a sexual predator's path and becomes his next target, Adam finds himself reconsidering his decision to stay away from her and fighting to keep her alive. He only hopes she forgives him when she finds out the truth about him...I liked this story - most of it, anyway. Adam and Izzy were very likable and had good chemistry together. Their relationship progressed a bit too fast, but not in a completely unbelievable way. Izzy's reaction when she finally finds out Adam's identity and the bargain he's made with her father was predictable and I couldn't help feeling somewhat disappointed because I'm not fond of that particular clich&eacute;. On the bright side, I really liked their love scenes. Skinny-dipping at the beach, anyone? ;)As for the suspense, I was surprised when I realized that Adam wouldn't be playing an active role in investigating and catching the bad guy. His job was to protect Izzy, and it was up to the police to chase and get the man who was after her. It was refreshing to get the detectives' POV, as secondary characters rarely get to have that kind of attention, but their scenes were rather bland and I never got fully engaged in the progress of their investigation.All in all, this was an okay read.

I found it to be enjoyable, suspenseful and quite erotic also. However...While I very much enjoyed the chemistry between  Izzy (Isabelle Ballentine) and Adam Marcellus; as it rang very true...I found myself at times having trouble staying with story line.The main story line is how Adam, an Ex-Marine turned Security Specialist is in Coconut Bay to protect Izzy. This is without Izzy's knowledge and done under the auspices of her father, a wealthy man from Savannah, Georgia.  Adam is supposed to convince Izzy to return to Savannah.  Will she or won't she.  The secondary story line involves a very creepy sexual predator and some of the best scenes involve Izzy.What then is my problem with Dangerous Secrets?  For me, it was that the transitions between the scenes with Izzy/Adam to the scenes where the Villain is involved tend to be very abrupt and draw me out of the story line, forcing me to go back up and reread and see why I didn't see that the transitions was coming.  I think something as simple as *** between the scenes would have helped me tremendously.That aside, I found Dangerous Secrets to be well worth reading.

Adam has alpha written all over him but he keeps his chest thumping to a minimum. Izzy is a strong enough woman to balance his character.

Traumatic experiences in both their development years left them with wounds that never quite healed--wounds received from being innocently trustful.Izzy, a college-educated, rich girl that ""kicked over the traces"" because of an overprotective father, makes her own way by tending bar in Mad Dog's Bar and Grille. Adam, who survived the means streets of New Orleans, eight years in the Marines, and a few years in the security business, is now on a clandestine mission that tests his control to the limit as he deals with Izzy. Her spunk, work ethic, and even her forgetting and acting like a `princess' at times makes him love her, fear for her, and grieve because he knows he will lose her.A terrifying deranged antagonist makes Dangerous Secret bloodcurdling at times. His cruelty is unspeakable. When Izzy, with Adam hot on her heels, foils one of the perp's best-laid plans, all his rage is focused on Izzy.The other characters in the story function to highlight Izzy and Adam's situation. These characters are not well developed but they do help build suspense, horror, and at times a sense of normalcy into Izzy and Adam's world--a world that seems to be out of control quite often.While trust issues with a `the poor boy' and `rich girl' or vice versa plot is not unusual, Katie Reus gives it a special twist that makes it exciting Her love scenes are breathtaking. The crime scenes horrify. Katie Reus grabs the reader's attention and imagination as she propels the story along at top speed making it feel like things will surely spin totally out of control if the reader doesn't keep reading until the last `i' is dotted and the last `t' is crossed.Dangerous Secrets takes the reader on a roller coaster ride going from horror to ecstasy.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re..."

Kind of reminded me of a plot in one of Stephen King's books: ""The Dark Half"" but lighter and totally different in writing style. Dawkins dialogue is often humorous even in what is a serious situation, making this an unusual read for me.  It grabbed me right off, but when the main character takes on an unexpected dark side I almost stopped reading it.  It just seemed unrealistic, and so out of character for the main character, who is also named Dan Dawkins, like the author. I wondered about that, anyone know why?  ... I certainly hope it is not an autobiography... yikes!  The main character often ponders how differently his life would've turned out if he had taken different forks in the road, but yet he never asked himself why he was so determined to unload his guilty conscience onto his wife, and immediately too.  He sneaks out of a hotel room and rushes home to confess. If he had kept quiet none of what transpired would have happened and altered his life to this degree... but then this novel wouldn't take place.Slight spoilers ahead:  Actually, I'm glad I chose to continue with the story even though I found it far-fetched that he Jekyll/Hyded us. Apparently it can happen, but rarely.  I liked the writing style.  The characters are well developed. I especially liked the old couple he stayed with after leaving town and settling in Oklahoma. You felt like you know these people, could almost smell the scents in the kitchen as all the cooking and baking took place.  Dan really seemed to like them also, making this even more conflicting emotionally for Dan and the reader. The remainder of the story, even though it had some gruesome scenes, kept me interested in the outcome.  I was surprised the outcome didn't come around sooner.  I expected the guy who issued him his fake I.D. to anonymously report the name to the police after it was broadcast all over the local news, or for someone in town to recognize him.I found it hard to believe that the Dan we get to know initially, before losing his wife, can actually flip on us and take on the Jackson persona, with no conscience or regrets for his choices, when his conscience was so prevalent in the beginning, that's what got him in this mess to begin with.  Otherwise I might have given this a 5 star rating.  A more descriptive title might have been ""Jackson Whole"" or ""The Making of a Murderer.""

I've read some domination/submission literature before, but I always found it too fake and frustrating to really enjoy the concept - if you look at something like Saalih'sHarem Girl, no one ever has to use (or even gets to have) safe words because the Dom is always magically aware of the Sub's needs, desires, and limits, and it's just pure fantasy and my mind disconnects from the unreal characters after awhile.I'm pleased and surprised at how relatively realistic ""Management Skills"" is. Author Rowe is clearly of the mindset that the Dom portion of the relationship carries a significant burden of responsibility to constantly be aware of the Sub's actual (not perceived) needs, and to engage the Sub in dialogue and ""re-negotiation"" as necessary to ensure that they're actually happy and not just submissively pretending to be. This is, in fact, probably the most realistically successful Dom/Sub relationship I've seen in literature - both members are publicly strong, respected figures and they care enough about each other to really engage in dialogue and discuss their needs and desires as the relationship evolves.As such, the ""management skills"" implied in the title is all about being a good Dom who takes proper care of their Sub. At least half of the novel revolves around discussions and internal monologues about this subject, as the Dom here struggles to deal with his controlling nature - he starts with good intentions of wanting to increase his Sub's pleasure, but then starts to spiral into a need for control that would actually do nothing to increase her pleasure and would end in her being very unhappy with the relationship. His Sub has to decide whether to leave the relationship or speak to him frankly and honestly about her real needs and how to mesh them with his own.I do like this as a very frank and realistic discussion about light Dom/Sub play, and I think as a ""manual"" for role playing in the real world, outside of the fantasy bounds of erotica literature, that this novella has a lot to offer, but I'm not sure that erotica fans will be blown away by the actual content. There's actually not a whole lot of sex here, and it's heavily framed by long discussions and internal worries about the relationship and where it's heading. The story ends on a happy, positive note, but very abruptly and with very little warning.I think, if you're looking for a more ""realistic"" approach to Dom/Sub relationships, this book is a good, positive piece that is definitely worth a look, but if you're just looking for a hot read, there are probably faster-paced novellas available.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this book provided through NetGalley.~ Ana Mardoll",Amazon Customer

She can't wait to get out in the field and show them what she is capable of.  She doesn't count on her boss recognizing her as Silver, the former exotic dancer she used to be.  She can't believe he is the man she used to dance for and dream about in the audience.Grant has desired Silver since that first night he saw her on stage.  She was off limits then but now she works for him and he is determined to have her.  He won't stop until he owns her, its all or nothing.Allie and Grant are both driven individuals that are very good at what they do.  Grant built his company from the ground up and Allie has quickly made a name for herself in their industry.  They share similar tastes and desires but they each fill a different role in the relationship.Throughout the book we get little glimpse's of Allie's past and how it has shaped her today.  She wants to give in to Grant but she is scared because of what happened before.  We see her grow both professionally and personally.  With Grant's help, she learns to trust and love again.I loved the ending, throughout the whole book Grant remains in total control and keeps his passion reigned in.  It's nice to see him pushed to the point that he is so turned on that he gives in to his desires with turn abandon.  I think he's met his match in Allie.Overall I enjoyed Management Skills and give it 3 Flaming Hearts.","Heather Brewer ""Heather"""
46262,B004MPRZK2,3,Entertaining Read,A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"[6, 6]","Management Skills has one of the most original takes on ""attraction across a crowded room"" I've ever read.Grant Edmonds first sees Allie Fairfax when she's performing as ""Silver"", an erotic dancer in a production he designed the lighting for. Grant is immediately attracted to her, but the club has a no interaction rule between dancers and patrons so he can't even meet her. He meets her again when she's hired as a production manager at his lighting effects company. He immediately realizes she's the ""Silver"" who has fueled his sexual fantasies for years.Grant is a strong character who knows what he wants. He comes from a large family and is very grounded. He tells Allie he doesn't just want a relationship, he wants to own her. I questioned his forthrightness because he had no idea of her background. He also has a strong insistence for the truth. Yet I never understood if there was a reason for this, or if this was just part of his character.Allie has fought hard to erase her past as an erotic dancer. She's strong, confident, and dresses for the job she wants. She finished school, and worked her way up. She's excited at her new job until she meets her boss, Grant, who recognizes her from her former life. When Grant tells her he wants to own her, she doesn't immediately say yes because she was previously in a D/s relationship that ended badly.Although the book started out strong, it was an interesting combination of strong ideas, great sex play, abrupt scenes, and incomplete storylines. Some great starts included: the overall setting of a high tech lighting company, hot office sex, the Bed and Bondage, orgasm denial, and Allie rebelling against orgasm denial. Some abrupt scenes include: Allie deciding to have sex with Grant, the gaps between them being together, and the ending. Orgasm denial would have worked if they were interacting together. But when orgasm denial simply means that you don't see each other due to business trips, it didn't work for me. And the ending left me questioning what the relationship would ultimately be. Watching them transform from Grant simply owning Allie to a loving relationship would have been beautiful. I would classify this as a happy-for-now romance.Still, the author's voice is solid. There are no noticeable grammatical or spelling errors. The sex scenes and play were steaming and left me hot and blushing. What was needed to make this a truly stellar story is some follow through with character motivations. For example, Allie says yes to being owned by Grant after a business meeting with Satin who was previously owned by Grant. Something was there, but I didn't know Satin and Grant's story. I was left wondering what Allie saw that convinced her to be his submissive. I see great potential in Ms. Rowe's writing and I'll be looking for more from her as she continues to grow as an author. It's one step from the magic that would have made this book great.If you're looking for a hot romance with interesting characters and a unique setting, try Management Skills. You'll especially enjoy the twist at the end.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re..."

Now he is the CEO of his own company and she is fortuitously working for him.Allie also recognizes him as the stranger she was attracted to from her days as a dancer. Their instant recognition ignites their past attraction to each other. After a night of passion and a lot of coaxing on Grant's behalf, they fall into a long-term Dom/sub relationship. Through this relationship, they learn to love and trust one another implicitly.Management Skills by January Rowe is a short erotic novel. The story offers insight into the world of BDSM and its mysterious, well mysterious to me, erotic lure. This facet of the the hero and heroine's relationship is the glue that binds their feelings for each other into something deep and meaningful. That being said/written, I did not really get into this book. I am just not a huge fan of BDSM.Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!!","Laurielu ""Bona Fide Reflections"""
46349,B004MYFO4M,4,Action packed plot gripped me from the start,A3P1U60SH8JKV5,"[3, 4]","I really enjoyed this book and found the fast pace and well thought through progression of it was amazing. The main character was very likable and his devotion to the female he loved was incredibly endearing. I also totally loved the way the last page ends.Plot wise I was hooked from right at the start and it didn't let go until the very last word. It reminded me a lot of Dean Koontz and as he is one of my favourite authors that's no bad thing at all.Based on plot and characters alone I want to give this book 5 stars. I really was very impressed by it, however, I am afraid I can't.There were a few minor things for me that took the edge off what would have otherwise been a perfect book. Firstly I got very lost knowing where the characters were all the time. They seemed to travel a lot but always seemed to be in the same town. For someone running from the cops this seemed a little odd and had me very confused at a few points.Secondly I found there were a few too many grammar and spelling mistakes in it for me. I'm quite sensative to those, however, so don't expect that to put everyone off. I've definitely seen a similar amount in more traditionaly published books.Thirdly as a Christian I found the few anti-christian references a little annoying. At one point the book very firmly suggests that Tim is just another incarnation of Jesus Christ and for me that was past the point I'd be happy with. I know almost all sci-fi in nature does not lend itself to being very Christian but this one went a little too far. So I'd recommend this book more for non-Christians.","Amazon Customer ""Jess Mountifield"""

46351,B004MYFO4M,3,Undigested,A1GTHK59BU3H4E,"[5, 7]","""Never Saw it Coming"" sold itself as a gritty action book, with a lot of creative plot ideas, twists and turns, and religious/philosophic undertones. It met some of its promises, but failed in others, and for that deserves a mixed review.What I really liked about this book was the author's sense of humor. The humor was both the book's shining star, and occasionally it's biggest failing. The author's voice was also great. It was unique and really held my attention. He has a gift for writing.However, the plot and the characters in the book were not well handled. Tim Finnegan is an immature, smart-mouthed, belligerent, and wholly unsympathetic protagonist, whose first reaction in most situations is to punch someone in the face. My big quibble with Tim was that his monologue and actions didn't seem to be his own. Tim is portrayed as a loser alcoholic with a dead end job. Tim's monologue and actions were the voice and decisions of the author, forcing Tim to be a plucky action hero, always ready with a witty chapter ending one-liner. Because of this, Tim didn't seem real. The author's humor made reading his POV enjoyable, but it never came across as believable.When Tim's running monologue was funny, the story was fun to read. When it wasn't, the story wasn't. The majority of the dialogue was action move clich&eacute; (A lot of: ""Freeze!"" ""No!"" ""Get on the ground!"" ""Let's go."") The POV switches were unnecessary and seemed like a crutch or a diversion. This book should have been told entirely from Tim's perspective. That would have made it much smoother and easier to read.Despite all off this, M. Jordan is a good author. His voice is great, his tone is fun, and his pacing is even. I like his general writing style. This book just wasn't given enough time to ripen and coalesce in his head before it was published. If he published a new book; I'd check it out.","Benjamin Goshko ""SentientSurfer"""

There were a couple of places where the situations seemed a little far-fetched counterbalancing the storyline action with character building.The author does an excellent job creating the surroundings for this story line to unfold.My rating of 3 stars is due to a true comparative analysis for like-kind works available today.  I do personally believe that 4 and 5 star ratings should go for highly visible works demanded by the public and timeless classics (for example, Dan Brown DaVinci code would be a 4 star read while Tolkien's LOTR would be 5 star.)This is a solid piece of writing and highly recommended for readers who like a lot of action and thrill seeking.The author delivers.",Patrick D.

I love the ease it was to obtain and the cheap price. I enjoyed the comments by the author where he explains his inspiration for the collection. Bell is writing in the style of some of his favorite authors. Nothing wrong with that. However, I think fans of Bell who consider him to be a writer for the Christian market will be disappointed, surprised, or both that these are not Christian stories. In fact, some of them are quite dark. In spite of the darkness, they are entertaining and fun to read.WATCH YOUR BACK, is a novella featuring Cameron Cates. Cates works at a large company in the IT department. He's engaged to Ann, who is trying to get him to go to church with her and her family. Cates doesn't believe he needs God. Meanwhile, co-worker Laine is showing him attention. She's beautiful and tempting to Cates. Soon, Cates falls under her spell and his life falls out from underneath him. I had a problem with how easy Cates succumbed to Laine and the other wrong things he did. His character wasn't developed enough for me to truly believe he'd throw everything away for Laine.The three short stories are quite effective on giving a twist to a predictable setup. In Foreplay, a rich married PGA golfer meets his match in a ravishing beauty. In Rage Road , the tables are turned on a man who commits an act of violence. In Heed the Wife, a man is forced by a controlling wife to commit a crime.Regardless of what you think of Bell 's stories here, I think we're seeing a future of publishing where well known authors release books electronically, and get to keep the money all for themselves. Bell has quite a following in the Christian market, and these stories won't be for all of them. These stories are meant to entertain, nothing more, and nothing less.",Bill Garrison

I was sucked into those books because V.J. Chambers wasn't scared to pull the blanket off the typical YA books.  She wrote what teenagers felt and did.  With hormones raging and cursing galore, she caused such controversy in that trilogy.  There was also a lot of action and the female lead wasn't a Bella Swan.  She was strong and fought for her life through each book.  I admired her and I admire Chambers to be able to bring such a character to life.With all of this being said, I thought Brighter was okay..  Not something I expected to see from Chambers at all.  I still like how she delivers the characters and keeps the suspense locked down at all the appropriate times. I still thought the main character was likable.Ramona is stuck in the her town...wondering where to go with her life now.  But then, things start happening.  Things that make her question what is really going on in this town and if the others who claim that the town sucks you in were lying or if what they were saying should be taken in a literal sense.  As things start unfolding Ramona is stuck wondering who she should and shouldn't trust...not knowing who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.  She soon learns she must trust no one.I don't want to give away spoilers and while I thought this book was decent, I hated the ending.  It was the bad beginning to a promise of a series.  I don't think Chambers has plans to continue with a series which is why the ending fell short for me.The writing was good and from what I remember there weren't very many errors if any at all.  The characters that matter are developed and you find yourself rooting for them.  Chambers creates a world all her own and brings eeriness to the book and you are left wondering exactly what is going on.  Suspecting anything from Aliens to Supernatural beings....the list goes crazy when you try to figure it out with Ramona.  I do remember my heart racing at some points hoping that a certain this or that wouldn't happen and that Ramona would make it out.This book, thankfully, did not detour me from wanting to read other works by Chambers simply because I love the taboo of the books and how she isn't afraid to be the one to cause controversy.  I admire her boldness and I admire the way she develops her characters and thinks outside the norm and isn't afraid to go dark in a YA novel.I bought this book back when the price was much lower.  I noticed that Amazon was recommending me to review this book since I had just finished a book review for someone else so I thought I would go ahead and jump on over to do so and was appalled by the Kindle price of this.  $7.99 for a Kindle edition?  I just don't understand the logic behind this spike in pricing.  I've spoke with a ton of Indie Authors who agree that $2.99 for a normal-sized book is more than fair on Kindle edition.  Those writers are also saying that $7.99 -$9.99 is what they typically charge for their paperbacks.I'm no one to judge what Chambers thinks the value of her work is...but that's rather pricey for an indie authors ebook edition and as an avid reader you will never see me throw down that much for an ebook.  Never.  I'd rather browse Hastings' used section for paperbacks and get a book I can actually hold and sit on my bookshelf.  For the record, I wouldn't even purchase a kindle edition that cost this much by a traditionally published author.  The price, does not convey my actual review and isn't the reason I gave the book a 3-star by any means.  I prefer not to rate a book based on price.

46825,B004NEUM8Y,2,M/M with some M/F/M thrown in (some plot spoilers),A3OXXYZ53AIAR2,"[7, 11]","Two to two and a half stars.  While I liked the author's style of writing and the plot premise, I was waiting for the two men to fall as much in love with the woman as they were with each other.  Disappointingly, it never happened, at least not as I read it, and it seemed as though the principle relationship in this book was between the two men.  Hence part of the reason for the two star review.The two men grew up together, worked together, spent all their time together, and were best friends.  Yes, Duncan, had always been bi, and had a long term, undisclosed attraction to his best friend, Jake.  However Jake was always 100% heterosexual, and had never even been attracted to Duncan (or any other man - the book makes this very clear).  Then, out of the blue, the two men each dream of a strange woman, the same strange woman, and Emma dreams of them.  The dreams progress to daytime flashing in and out of each other's minds, and the sense of attraction to each other rises.  Jake was very attracted to Emma prior to any change in his feelings toward Duncan, which only began to come to him as the dreams and flashing in and out of each other's minds increased.  Even after meeting her, Jake was openly attracted to Emma, but was very uncomfortable with his newly emerging attraction to Duncan.As a woman reading an erotic romance set up as a M/F/M menage, I expect for the woman to be loved by both men, and to be loved on by both men, in at least equal amounts to any loving going on between the men alone.  Especially when the two men had not been in a sexual relationship with each other prior to both being sexually attracted to the woman.  This was not the case, sadly, and I kept waiting for the two men to begin treating Emma as an equal, rather than as an incidental third.  Most sex scenes were begun between the two men, even when Emma was in the room or at least the same house.  When she was present during the scene, sometimes they even concluded without her receiving any physical attention from the two men at all.  Even when she was physically involved, she appeared to be incidental, with the main focus of the scene being between the two men.  Sometimes she began a scene with Jake, then Duncan joined in only to focus far more on Jake, rather than ""sharing the love"" with Emma.In fact, the way the story was written, the only apparent reason for the attraction the men felt toward Emma was this ""bonding.""  Prior to the bonding, the men were already in a very close relationship with each other, and who knows if Jake would have ever welcomed a physical relationship with Duncan.  However, there was no justification given for the men wanting Emma as a third other than the bonding.  So much so, that even Emma raised the question of whether they would love her without the bonding.  Despite the men's claims to the contrary, the author failed to provide sufficient reasons or actions by the two men to support any other conclusion than that it was solely the bonding that held the two men to Emma.  I could only agree with Emma's suspicion that if the three-way bonding had never happened, or if it were to disappear as suddenly as it appeared, Duncan and Jake would probably continue their M/M relationship, but Emma would be out in the cold.Another big issue for me was that the storyline was based upon a sudden, significant, unearthly phenomenon that directly affected the three of them, and yet the book just ended without any hint of explanation of what this was, why it was happening, etc.  The three developed extreme magical powers that grew exponentially in a very short period of time, and they seemed to accept it with little to no questioning.  We are never given any hint as to why bonding was suddenly happening around the world, how it was happening, and why these three people were experiencing such a drastically different bonding than the relatively few other bonding pairs - all others were couples, and none with the magical powers these three had. At the end of the story, no one knew anything about the purpose, cause or source of the bonding, and it was just presented as a new phenomenon that was now going to continue to happen.  The book raised far too many unnecessary, unaddressed questions, plot-wise, which is not something I search for in an erotic romance, even if this were to be the first in a series.  As far as I know, it is not, but if it were I would not care to read any more in the series.",A Bookaholic

The woman that completes this trio is Emma, a high school library teacher they have never met.I really did enjoy this read, I loved the interaction between the 2 men and how they cemented the feelings duncan has had the whole time. Emma added a perfect addition to the men. I loved the m/m scenes and the sexual chemistry that flowed between the 2 of them.The other scenes that included Emma were just as steamy.

Leaf soars past the elaborate premises many authors use to explain why threesomes are socially acceptable in their special `town'. Appassionato's passionate trio doesn't bother to explain or justify their relationship, which allows Leaf to focus on the meat of the story. And, wow, what a story!The buildup is simply delicious. Emma doesn't even meet Duncan and Jake until a quarter of the way into the novel, but we don't miss out on the building of their relationship one bit. Through a mysterious `bonding,' the three of them are suddenly able to feel one another's emotions and to communicate using telepathy. They talk to one another that way, and they have a few steamy encounters while dreaming. This is one of the most unique plot ideas I've ever seen, and Ms. Leaf's amazing writing talent swept me away.And the story doesn't stop there. At the heart of this novel is a drug cartel that wants to capture bonded couples to manufacture their blood into a drug. While this isn't a new concept, Ms. Leaf definitely makes it her own. The sex scenes were great, though some of the acrobatics were difficult to picture, but Ms. Leaf's ability to build characters and suspense kept me hanging on every word the entire way through.The novel is too long to read in one sitting, which I loved. I really, really wanted to spend more time with the trio--so much that I read it twice. More, Ms. Leaf, and fast!

46840,B004NEUSJW,2,"Promised much, delivered less.",A3URN31SN96BDN,"[6, 8]","1 1/2 STARS ROUNDED UP TO TWO FOR THIS ONE.I wanted to like this book. The premise was a good one for me - woman has abduction fantasies, needs them to be realistic, locked in car's toolbox which is picked up by repo man who appears he may be able to work with her fantasies in a more authentic fashion. One of my complaints is that hetero books often take a softly, softly approach because readers will be offended with things that happen to a female. This book promised to take things to a place that I sometimes want to go, but it failed to deliver.What I didn't like -1) Ember is way too trusting for BDSM with a man she's just met. Like ridiculously, dangerously trusting with a guy who is very strange and conflicted himself. She is co-dependent and sets subs and, in particular, women back 40 years. 2) Lucas is not particularly likeable or stable as a man, let alone as a supposed Dom. In my opinion he isn't a decent Dom, just a man releasing his pent-up frustrations by bossing people around. I wouldn't go near him with a 20 foot barge pole. 3) The brother, Matthew, was an annoying distraction, who went from bratty nutjob to (kind of) OK in 0-60 seconds. 4) Even the dog was obnoxious, down Daisy you stink. AND 5) Learning to Drown wins the worst editing of the decade award. I am not a writer, an editor or paid critic but the errors in this book were glaringly obvious to me. There were typos, grammatical errors and poorly formatted pages absolutely everywhere. It thoroughly slaughtered the flow of the book.What I liked -Hmmm. 1) The sex wasn't too bad. 2) The premise was good and, with better execution, could have been a very interesting book. 3) There is promise for dark works oustide of the standard hetero box with Sommer Marsden. 4) The cover was very appealing.Overall, Learning to Drown was a disappointing book.

What I will say is I loved Ms. Olinger's portrayal of heaven - angels in training, office of human resources, elevators to Earth, etc. I encourage her to write another story with a made up world full of silly characters. I feel she has a knack for this. I highlighted quite a few clever passages.The only drawback to the story (for me) was the similarity of the two male characters names. Jack Lynch and John Lydon. This was a problem for me. The story mentioned that these two characters were thrown together often in high school due to the spelling of their last names. That's fine, but did their first names have to be so similar? What was the reason for this? Many times during the first 30% of the story I found myself stopping and trying to remember which man was which. This interrupted the flow of the story for me.I'm sure this is only a problem for me. I also had issues with Stephenie Meyer's characters Charlie and Carlisle - two completely different men and people in her books.My Boyfriend's Back is a great story to read while you're waiting for your child to finish practice or during a soak in the tub.

47711,B004O0U7N2,2,Didn't like the characters & Felt like I was missing a prequel,A1LIDAK07R3AYE,"[2, 3]","Scott and Penny are firefighting partners. Each has come to realize that they romantically care for the other but have reasons to resist the attraction.  When Penny sprains her ankle, Scott moves into her house to help her out.This book felt like there was a prequel that I was missing.  First, at several points it was mentioned that Scott's sister had had been kidnapped by a serial arsonist who she helped to catch with her drawings.  The story mentioned people that I felt like I was supposed to know (Millie... who now had a renewed sense of purpose when Abby had her babysit her daughter several weeks ago).  Okay - so I felt like I was dropped into the  middle of this story.  The character's backstories also weren't discussed.  I THINK that Penny is just a volunteer firefighter.  It was mentioned that she had worked at a bank and was now a medic.  However, this was a throwaway line a few chapters into the book.  We know Penny is a widow and married to Jim.  However, we are never given information about when Jim died or anything about their life together.  Maybe it comes later in the book -- however, I would expect to know this by the 30% mark.  At this point, I know that Scott was married with a bad divorce; Penny was widowed.  However, I don't know their backstory.  I just can't feel for characters who I know nothing about.A second problem I had was that Penny seemed like two different people.  Half the time, Penny seemed to be coming on to Scott and wanted to kiss him and have a relationship with him.  And, at other times, she couldn't betray Jim (her dead husband) and she felt like dating someone would be like cheating on Jim.  And, we didn't get this behavior of ""oh I just kissed him and I don't know if I'm ready to move on"".  Instead, in some chapters (like by the car accident) she wanted to make out with Scott.  Then, when they move to her house, she doesn't want anything to happen because of her dead husband.  At least Scott was consistently torn... he wanted to be romantically involved but didn't trust love because of his bad marriage (which we never really learned about what was so bad). A lot of the book is them dwelling on their relationship (or lack thereof).The good of the book (why it is two stars) is that at least the grammar and spelling were fine.  Also, the author obviously knows something about firefighting.  This was both a strength and a weakness.  The author used firefighting terms which I had no clue what them meant (what is a ""Probie""?  What is the ""alpha side of the house""? What are ""turnouts"" -- from the context, it is something they wear?).All in all, I gave up 30% into the book as I was just so confused and I just didn't care for the characters or the constant thinking/talking about their relationship.",Janet Samuels

This is a story of a young woman being swept off her feet by the man of her dreams, only to find that the life of luxury he provides is one full of stress, abuse, neglect, and lies. This auto-biography takes you through the years of Sarah's marriage to this charismatic man, to include the births of their three children. You become emotionally invested in this story as you read further and further into the story of her life.This story makes me think of my first marriage. It makes me think if I hadn't gotten out as quickly as I did, how my life might have turned out so much differently. You begin to see inside the relationship, instead of seeing it from the outside-in. You begin to see the suffering one goes through privately, while trying to hold things together publicly.This book is a very good read. In fact, I managed to read the entire book in only a couple of hours. I am really glad that Sarah found her way out of the situation she found herself in. I am also sad that other women had been and would continue to fall victim to such a man. Mental illnesses so often go undiagnosed and untreated in so many lives. This book serves to shed light on a personality disorder that will destroy the lives of people all around the individual it affects, while the actual individual continues to blame his or her misfortunes on someone else. I applaud you, Sarah, for sharing your story with the world through your book.I'm giving this book 3 spiders and recommending it to everyone.SB Price",DJ Weaver
48524,B004OL25XG,4,Unexpectedly disturbing,A18FIHA7C2TJB4,"[5, 5]","I don't know why I found this book so unexpectedly disturbing, as I know quite a bit about narcissism from first-hand experience. Perhaps that's *why* I found it so disturbing. Sarah Tate as a young, naive woman gets totally caught up in a suave older man's seduction games and marries him within a year of his previous wife's suicide. The saddest thing to me is that she doesn't even find him attractive, but the lure of money and material things he promises (which often symbolize love to women, let's face it) is so seductive. I'm not saying that she is a shallow person, but it is very sad that women are so vulnerable to this kind of insidious lying, which is all about making them feel special in the short term. Because by the end of the book it's revealed that ""Bill"" is a total monster of deceit and specializes in running up enormous, staggering debts. What's really fascinating is the way Sarah gives us a candid look at their married life. Once the honeymoon wears off, it's all about stress for the woman, and the desperate need to put a good face on things.Although Sarah represses her rage and despair most of the time, when she does find out exactly what Bill is up to behind her back, there's a very satisfying scene where she starts to take back her power.The awful truth of what really happened to Bill's second wife makes the book even more powerful.Ultimately, the saddest thing about narcissism is that well-meaning witnesses are ineffective; the narcissist's spell is so strong. After reading this book I began to see narcissism as a sort of Ponzi scheme, where the narcissist feeds off one victim and uses the money and resources remaining from that destroyed relationship to attach to another victim. The lies begin again. It seems society is set up so that bragging, lying men are protected, in a way. (It's true Bill keeps getting fired, but he also keeps getting work!) Kind of makes you wonder about the human race. But Tate has written a gripping book, which I read in one sitting. Although one reviewer complained it was all about one woman's marriage and not enough about narcissistic relationships in general, I disagree. This is an unwavering portrayal of what a destructive narcissist does in a relationship, from beginning to end. I think it could open a lot of eyes.",Gabriella West

When I first decided to take on this book review, I had read a few paragraphs of the story and started to dread it. What else could someone possibly say about the life of a drug deal who has obviously cracked? I put the Nook aside and decided to save it for another day. Having said it before, I will always give a book my best shot. No matter how much it does not entertain me I will at least try especially when the author contacted me for a review. Once I finished up school for the summer, I decided to give it a go. I scanned back through the first chapter to refresh my memory. I then sat up the whole night finishing the book. Meet Adiran, messed up druggie extraordinaire. Typical, and yes, rather clich&eacute;. But how else can you describe the main character from a drug addicted novella? You wanted to love Adiran, but you hated him for messing up his life. You wanted him to be loved, to have love, and get out of this train wreck of a life he was living. You wanted to know he was going to clean up his life. That doesn't happen. There is no fairytale love story hidden within these pages. Instead, the pages are littered with drug use, drug deals, sex, crimes, and death. After death, there is revenge which does nothing more than create more death and an ending that leaves your ripping out your hair, screaming ""I WANT MORE!"" It can possibly end just like that. What happened to...... You will get sucked in. You will find yourself full of emotions and right when you think you have the story all figured out..............it ends. I am thrilled with the emotional roller coaster ride Silvano Williams took me on. Now I sit here, pounding away at the keyboard wondering....will there be more? When can I find out what happens to Adiran? Do the police catch up with him? Does he overdose? Spend the rest of his life in prison? Or, maybe he falls in love while on the run and heads to Mexico.... Hey, a girl can dream (or in this case make up the ending to a story not written)",Chrystal Mahan

If I am honest, I was not sure I was going to like this book, but I once I got past the slow start, I saw the potential the book had. The book starts off with a diary entry from Angela. You do not know her role in the story, only that she is connected to Adiran, and fancies herself in love with him. She admits that she did not get to know him as well as she should have but she also refuses to share what she knows with people that ask her. She talks about how Adiran talked about a cruel God that judged him and how she would not let that God judge her. It is understood that Adiran died and that she wants to join him.The story then starts from Adiran's point of view. Adiran is a drug dealer/user that lives hard and fast. He is young and jaded, with no real purpose in life and no reason to think that life will get any better. Murder and death are the norm in his life. The last day of his life starts off with a simple drug pickup and exchange that sets off a chain of events that lead to the end of his life. As short as this book is I do not want to get into many details or it will give too much away. I will just say that Adiran describes his whole feelings on life, while he is high on acid and pot. The acid trips seem realistic (not that I would know!) and Adiran's moodiness and worldview is basically a foul-mouthed rant at the unfairness of the world. Some of it is actually quite funny, though I am not sure that it was supposed to be. This story is about love and loss. Adiran loses many friends and many people die on the last day of his life. Adiran's life ends with a crash and a bang. He in effect ruins so many lives around him on his last day. You think you know the ending but you are surprised at how it turns out, at least I was. All in all, I would give this book 3.5 stars. It had potential, it made me laugh and it also made me look at a side of life I am not familiar with. I am looking forward to reading more from Silvano Williams.Quotes from the book:""You think? Sounds to me pleasure took your carriage onto a dirt road and now you're complaining `cause you stepped in mud.""""Because most are afraid of change, they are afraid of themselves, and those in power are eager to use this fear against us.

I confess to knowing little of the life of a small time drug dealer before I read this, but the account of the descent into his own personal hell of Adiran was so well described you felt he was a friend who needed your help.Adiran&#8217;s friends, both the young men and the girls, were equally well described and seemed real.It was well up to the standard I have come to expect from this author and I recommend it.***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official***",Derek White

And I'm glad I did!The only thing I didn't really like was knowing what was going to happen at the end.

Silvano Williams does a spectacular job painting Adiran's tormented thought process.  It was also interesting reading about Adiran's opinions of people that he ""worked"" with.  Silvano can also be very insightful - see quote:""Love is like religion. Such a complex answer for an unneeded question. Who needs gods when there is the truth?

It describes the harsh choices of this character and the reality of what life could be depending upon his choices. This man-child loses his way and was led by dark forces to become discouraged and choose the path which could destroy his destiny and all he cherished, or to choose a different path. A powerful event fuels his rage and hurts him driving him to take actions that led to impulsive actions which may predict his future. It is filled with action and touching scenes.

The opening is a sex scene, but don't let that deter you - it sets the stage for the basis of the plot and is key to understanding the mind of the killer.  There is an undertone of a romance novel as well, but the interaction between Arden Jones and Bill Ashton is well written and does not detract from the story in any way.  (I am not a fan of the traditional romance novel either.)  I found myself rather enjoying their interaction throughout the story - the dialogue was sharp and witty without being unrealistic, flowery or syrupy-sweet.  The sub-plot about Samantha's pre-abduction activities added another layer to the story, as well as some very fun and enjoyable twists and turns in the story.  Add all this to a mix of small-town characters, and the result is a book that is difficult to put down.Yes, the book could have used a little more proof-reading, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I did not think it was a major distraction.

I both understand and acknowledge that religion played a very large part in societies of those times (Clarendon Code/ Corporation Act of 1661 and all that)... however, instead of smoothly writing in religious undertones that would compliment the storyline and steer the plot along, the author may as well have shoved a bible down your throat with a side helping of hellfire and damnation.Anna is 19 years old - her father was the vicar of their village but has recently passed away, leaving her alone with her ailing mother. In every description of Anna, we're told that she's this beautiful innocent - sweet, giving, extremely pious, and willing to work hard to take care of her mother. Which is why she immediately takes a position as governess that the [not to be trusted] Squire offers her. The very first night Anna spends in the house she's almost raped by the Squire. The very first night. Oh, and she bludgeons him upside the head with a candlestick, runs home to her mother sobbing, then both of them have to flee for their lives.Okay... I get that the author was trying to kick-start some conflict, but really? It's 1661 and Anna is 19 - she'd have been fair game for years! All of a sudden her father dies and she's more accessible? Where was her father keeping this stunning yet innocent beauty, a closet?Soon we have two more men to add to Anna's list of lustful stalkers. Despite the fact that she's dressed in the black mourning garb of a borderline peasant, apparently she still looks like sex on a stick... or the entire male cast of this novel are wearing beer goggles. I can't help but think of the movie ""There's Something About Mary"" - you know... maybe There's Something About Anna. Except that we don't really know what that ""something"" is...ever.But I digress...I really don't have the energy to list everything that's wrong with this story - there's simply too many historical flaws, plot holes, timeline blunders, convenient occurrences, spelling/grammar errors, character inconsistencies, ragged transitions, and flavorless attempts at ""romance"". Top off an entire book of obsessive, maniacal, gloom and doom with a ridiculously simple (and utterly convenient) happy wrap up, and there you have it. Voila!***Spoilers***Here are a few points that really annoyed me (among many):- Highly religious Anna who can't seem to stop spouting religious teachings for longer than it takes her to gulp in her next breath... feels perfectly fine with having sex before marriage.  Um, no.- Every single solitary message that Ravensbourne sends to Anna and his sister while he's in hiding get either confiscated or lost - and when he sends his buddy Daventry with a message, that doesn't get through either. Oh, but Daventry was not only able to speak with Ravensbourne's servants, but also talked to people in town enough to find out that everyone thought Ravensbourne was dead, Charlotte was whipped into marrying a friend of Melcotts, Anna's mother was dead and Anna was to marry Melcott.  Ridiculousness.- Melcott and the Squire were able to hear and see everything that went on in the Dower house while simultaneously talking and masturbating outside the window... and yet, no one heard them? Gee, how utterly convenient. And how on earth would Ravensbourne know what the Squire looked like, huh? Yeah... he wouldn't.- A thousand pounds to marry Charlotte? Um, no.- When exactly in the year did everything take place? How many months went by? The book starts off with a ""chill wind"", there's talk of growing crops to eat (like potatoes), but then mentioning the ""first snowfall"", and then Ravensbourne mentions being in the Netherlands for months, next scene Anna says he's been gone weeks.... what the heck is going on? Throw the name of a month in there for pity's sake. Sheesh.- Anna getting married to Melcott when she's in mourning for her mother (and probably still in mourning for her father)? Um, no.- Ravensbourne taking in some random, filthy girl that runs up to him looking for help? In these times, with poverty absolutely rampant? Um, no.","Eva J. ""Moving at the speed of dark"""

Earthlings land on a planet that seems very fertile, but as they try to grow crops, nothing grows. Then, natives of the planet, Alaahi, non-corporeal spiritual beings appear. They say that they also had problems with the land until they gave up their bodies. The ground does not want to produce for the earthlings. However, if each earthling joins by an umbilical cord to an Alaahi, the ground will produce. Many, but not all the earthlings agree. After they join together, the ground begins to produce.But other earthlings claim they have been duped. Ask yourselves, they say, why did the Alaahi do this? What do they really want? Do you really believe that they did this for altruistic reasons? Abrams, a leader of the dissenter group tells the linked earthlings that he can help them.Neya, age 16, sees her father stick his hand into a fire and scream in agony; and she watches his Alaahi symbiant die. She rushes for help to Elijah, age 18, and his father and discovers that the father also has a burned hand, and he and his symbiant are dead.

They struggled on until some of the other colonists said they had seen apparitions, and soon the Alaahi made themselves known, because they had been there all along.  They convinced the people that by joining with them they could grow food and make the planet sustainable for life and all would be well.  The alaahi joined with the humans by an umbilical-like cord and so the two became a team.The story follows a young girl named Jena and her symbiont, Neya and Jena's father.  Jena and Neya get along very well, and talk about everything under the sun.  But to some of the humans, including Jena's father, something about the symbionts doesn't seem right.What happens from there on out is very exciting and quite uncertain.  The story takes on a rebellious tone, but from which side is to be found out by the reader.  It becomes even more exciting when the Baptist minister becomes involved.I found this to be a very well-written sci-fi story, and I don't read science fiction much at all.

I especially enjoyed how the story was told solely from the man's perspective, which is a bit different in the romance world.I can't say I have personal experience with OCD, but Potter created a character for whom I found myself rooting. I wanted Dwayne to grow, learn, evolve, & overcome. I wanted him to be happy (even though I can't stand his name). More than anything, I found myself entranced with dissecting the whys & hows of Dwayne's life & reactions to the things which happened to him. I would've liked to go deeper, but Potter said no. That's ok, I was still entertained (but I probably would've more likely given a 5-star rating if I could've dissected Dwayne a bit more).The heroine, Dee-Dee, could have used a little more fleshing out, but I still liked her. She seemed perfect for Dwayne & would hold him accountable while offering comfort & safety. Prose wasn't always as good as it could've been, & some of the dialogue seemed a bit stretched to me, but overall, the writing was often better than it was not. Resolution of Dwayne's work life would've been appropriate, & I would've liked to learn a bit more about some of the side characters, but neither was truly necessary to enjoy the story.Suffice it to say, this is an interesting, different book that is fun to read b/c it's so unusual.

OCD in many ways can ruin your life. Reading ""Bent, Not Broken,"" was especially gratifying, as it portrays the true agony that one goes through with this hard to treat condition. What's especially nice about this book, is that the author is able to write in such a fashion that the book reads like a novel, yet at the same time he offers a great deal of insight to those who would normally benefit from reading self-help books.Reading a story about the lives and struggles of real individuals is so much more enlightening than reading a self-help book about OCD and it causes and cures. Through the narrative of William Potter, we meet Dwayne, a person who's severely afflicted with OCD and its accompanying anxiety. We see how through no fault of his own, he's bullied at work and constantly made fun of through practical jokes. To the person suffering from OCD, these little taunts become gigantic weights that can take forever to rid yourself of.Dwayne puts up with everything, always doing more work than anyone else at his place of employment, despite the huge obstacles he faces. Then he meets Dee-Dee and a whole new world opens up for him. Dee-Dee doesn't solve Dwayne's problems, and in many ways actually compounds them. But that's the power of OCD; it prevents you from living life to the fullest. When Dwayne's life becomes entwined with Dee-Dee, the OCD makes it all the more difficult to have a successful relationship, despite the overwhelming desire to do so.The reader can very much relate to the agony that Dwayne continues to go through, even after meeting up with Dee-Dee. In the end, the power of love and the willingness for another person (Dee-Dee) to try to understand what Dwayne is going through, shows the reader that all is not hopeless. There is indeed a light at the end of the tunnel. Dwayne's behavior, like many others suffering from OCD, takes the form of having to be in control of his entire existence. Whether it be keeping things in exact order, or performing what we would think of as ridiculous mental exercises, such as counting routines, to Dwayne these things are very real and virtually impossible to dispel.""Bent, Not Broken,"" exemplifies the power of understanding, compassion and love. This insightful book brings the reader inside the mind of a person suffering from OCD, and the everlasting power of empathy, love and understanding that when given to someone from the heart, can change a persons life forever. This is definitely a 5 star read from an exceptionally talented author.","Expressed Reviews ""Expressed Reviews"""

Once in Fatal Bluff, she is forced to continue the charade and seek employment. No one's hiring--well, the local bar does need another harlot and the Sheriff needs a housekeeper. Not happy about being in the home of a lawman because of her outlaw husband, Katherine is determined to stick it out for the month and then try to outrun her husband. Sheriff Connor Langston doesn't want a wife or any woman in his life, but realizes he needs help with his 8 year-old niece and home. He's not happy about having Kate around, especially since he's becoming more and more attracted and attached to her. He can tell she's hiding something and not sure what that could mean to him and his niece.THE OUTLAW BRIDE was a well written and moving story. The POV switches between Kate and Connor, but nothing is rehashed or repeated. The story moves along quickly and smoothly, slowly building the relationship between the two. The changes that occur felt natural and right. I loved that we saw both Kate and Connor grow, as well as get to know each other and relax around each other. Everyone in town *thinks* they know what's going on, but they have no idea.Kate and Connor both, as well as the townsfolk around them, were very well developed. The romance that builds and builds was done perfectly. Ms. Boyce uses so many subtle changes to show the buildup of tension between Kate and Connor. Even then, she doesn't just throw them into bed together and wrap a bow around it. Everything had such a feeling of real life that I became absorbed into the story.The plot involving Kate's outlaw husband was done very well. We feel Kate's anxiety right from the start as she's trying to avoid detection at the train station. Throughout the story the agitation grows until a major confrontation in the end.I loved this story. It was beautifully executed.

Western Romance was my first love as a romance reader, and it remains a favorite of mine even as publishers and the market have followed other trends. For several years, it was almost impossible to find great new Western Romance authors. In recent years, offerings have improved somewhat, especially with smaller presses giving new opportunities for those who write and read Westerns. But, true Western Romance stills feels like a tiny prairie flower peeking out of a forest of Paranormal, Shape-shifting, Sexy, Contemporary Cowboy, Regency, Erotica, Serial Killer trees. And Boyce brings us Western Romance at its purest--Fans of Linda Lael Miller, Jodi Thomas, Susan Kay Law, Paty Jager, et al will love Boyce.Outlaw Bride contains all of my favorite Western romance tropes--mistaken identity, mail-order bride gone awry, woman running from her abusive past, Gruff Sheriff Tortured Hero Deluxe and Sexy edition, orphaned child in need of mothering, and great secondary characters providing comic relief, emotional support, and a sense of community. Kate is on the run from her outlaw husband who tried to kill her. A western law man died saving her life, and she's trying to repay him by seeking out his family. Connor Langston is that family BUT he's also the Sherriff of Fatal Bluff.Kate must tread carefully, especially since Connor believes her to be Hannah Stockdale, a wayward mail-order bride he hires to be his housekeeper and caretaker for his niece. It's a convoluted set-up, but it totally works and contains a number of hilarious moments along the way. Kate finds herself first using the case of mistaken identity for Hannah Stockdale as means to escape her husband and make it to Fatal Bluff and then as a means of staying and getting close to the Langston family as she tries to figure out the best way to fulfill the legacy of the man who died saving her. Connor, however, is no idiot, and he gradually grows to suspect that she's not who she says she is, and their delicate dance as they try to find a way to trust each other is beautiful.

Endearing and sweet with a touch of spice for flavor The Outlaw Bride is one of the best historicals I've read in a while. There was only one hitch, some of the editing hiccups were a little too noticeable and become annoying.Still, it's clear Kelly Boyce has a lot to offer the world of the historical romance and I look forward to reading more of her works. It is rare that a historical is filled with this many memorable characters. She needs to host a workshop on character development so that others can benefit from her expertise.Originally posted at the Long and Short of It Romance Reviews","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re..."

Unlike the heroine's wild red locks, there was nothing out of place in this book. The plot was polished, the characters developed, the style and voice fit perfectly with the setting.

Uninterested, the police believe she saw a practical joke rather than a murder. But someone is stalking and terrorizing her, visiting her grandmother in her nursing home, running her car off the road, and making her life a nightmare. She knows she's in danger, but has a hard time accepting that reality. Finally, having no one to turn to who will believe her, she calls her ex-boyfriend, Will.Will, an ex-cop, is now a private investigator. He assigns himself as Megan's protector. In order to do this, he moves in with Megan to make sure that she is safe. He is the only one who takes the danger seriously. Competent, handsome and sexy, Will can't keep his hands or his mind off Megan. They have a burning, irresistible sexual attraction that neither can deny. Will, still in love, wants her back.Megan has been in love with Will since she broke off their relationship quite some time ago. Her grandmother, an old fashioned African American woman, won't accept a mixed race relationship for her granddaughter. Because of this and the racially ugly words Will's mother said to her before Megan decided to end their relationship, Megan doesn't believe that their love can last.Will was unaware of the mean and hurtful things and was heartbroken when Megan left. He does his best to convince her of his love and that he wants a commitment, but Megan can't let go of her fears and the belief that she would only hurt him again.This story is packed with interesting characters, plenty of action and several prominent plot twists. I also found the descriptions of the criminals and their lives to be tough, gritty and complex, and sometimes a little too uncomfortable for me to read. The bad guys in this story are really bad and ugly. Convincing: yes. Often harsh: also, yes.The love story is the saving grace to this intensely powerful tale. Ms. Daniels writes a steaming hot romance that is multi-dimensional and satisfying. I recommend this story for those who don't mind graphic and vivid details of sexual abuse and violence, in keeping with the realistic quality of the storytelling.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews","LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re..."

As she closes down the realtor office, she sees what she believes is a murder of a young girl by a man whose face she can't see. For a split-second, the alleged murderer turns toward her office and Megan believes she's been seen. Moments later, she hears someone arriving and she runs - possibly for her life. When she calls the police, they brush off her concerns; after all, there's no body and no other witnesses.Fearful, she then calls her ex-boyfriend, Will McCoy, a man she still loves despite the break-up six years prior. What unfolds throughout the story is a mix of thrilling suspense - packed with chases and underhanded dealings, controversial memories - Megan is the child of a black mother and a white father who left and Will is from a prominent white family, and connections between two people who are more confused about the situation than anything.Wynter Daniels writes eloquently and descriptively, which is always a welcome read, especially in those catered to the sexier adult moments of life. The plot is decent and its execution is simple. There are no real mysteries regarding the characters after a few chapters, only niggling thoughts regarding them, some of which include whether or not Megan will ever make up her mind about Will when it's obvious she wants him more than anything.I don't have many problems with this book though I wasn't entirely blown away by the story itself. What did bother me, however, were what I felt were unnecessary glimpses into the lives of the secondary characters. While I think some scenes were important to understand the psyches of the characters, it sometimes felt overdone and extraneous within the books. At times, I wasn't sure why I needed to read particular scenes; it almost felt like the author felt the need to throw in another sexual scene to reach a quota.However, other than that, I would recommend PROTECTIVE CUSTODY to anyone who enjoys erotica with a touch of thrilling chase. There are certain scenes and conversations that lend themselves to the idea of racism but it shouldn't deter people from the book. Everything is written with care and in a way that the ideas are the result of times past. I don't think it's one of the best pieces of erotica out there (mostly due to the excess scenes) but I do enjoy that the plot includes something other than the building romance and manages to stay important throughout the length of the book. Many erotic works fall short with their focus only on sex but Daniels manages to give readers steamy scenes with a story that is both interesting and gripping.PROTECTIVE CUSTODY has a do it or die feel - things are always seemingly precarious with the result wobbling between two choices. Just like the main characters, readers should jump in with both feet.-- originally reviewed for Ordinary People, Extraordinary Works --",Mary Catherine

What I loved most about this book was that just when I thought I had everything worked out, another twist or turn happened that added another layer to the story. Will and Megan were hot together, and although it was frustrating at times watching both of them rationalize why they shouldn't be together, it was hard not to root for them finding their HEA. The mystery of the book had me turning the pages as fast as possible to find out what was going to happen next, but since there were so many characters and inter-connected story lines, I found myself slowing down to make sure I didn't miss anything.I just love second chance love stories, so it was easy for me to get sucked in to Will and Megan&#8217;s romance. It was heartbreaking watching Megan struggle with her love for her grandmother, her only family left, and her love for Will. It was frustrating to learn of the prejudices that existed from not only Megan&#8217;s grandmother, but Will&#8217;s family, and the impact they had on Will & Megan&#8217;s relationship. It was so clear that these two belonged together &#8211; I just wanted to yell at both of them to listen to their hearts!This was an action packed story that took off right from the beginning and never slowed down.

Imagine my surprise when I realized that I'd read a short erotic story you'd written only a week or so earlier. So I was pretty excited to give Protective Custody a shot, as I had enjoyed the short story.The premise of Protective Custody actually sounded, well, a bit boring.Witness to a murder, but no one will believe her...Shocked by the brutal crime she witnesses through the window of her small office, Megan Jackson calls the police and is devastated when they question the truth of her story. With no body and no evidence of a crime, she's written off as a nutcase.Megan suspects the killer saw her face. Terrified, she calls the only person she can trust-her ex-boyfriend and former police officer, Will McCoy.Despite a devastating breakup, Will jumps at the chance to help the woman who broke his heart. When the killer ramps up the stakes, Will is forced to take her into hiding-where the passion they once shared reignites, deeper and hotter than ever. But can Will keep Megan alive long enough to win back her heart?She saw a murder, her ex boyfriend is the only one she can think of to help her - blah blah blah. Been there, done that.One of the things that I most enjoy about reviewing books is when I'm made to eat my own words, and this time, I was.PROS: The characters were great, as was the interracial part of their relationship. There wasn't really any mystery, but there was a decent story, for which I was grateful to enjoy.CONS: The characters. While some characters, like Megan and Will's ""boss"" Ed, were great, Will himself needed work. He definitely seemed a bit ""pussy whipped"", and I didn't like that about him. I wanted him to be a lot stronger of a character than he actually was.While I enjoyed this story, there was much more that could have been done to make it better. I definitely think you have promise as a writer, Ms. Daniels, but I also think that you could do much better than you did. There are a few things missing from this story - a bit more action, a bit more adventure, and you would have a best seller.",Randi Morse
